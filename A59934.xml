            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41908:13"/>
unto others the illuſtrious nature and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, as in the Text.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle from the 14th verſe of the former Chapter, celebrates the ſongs of his triumph in Chriſt for the Great efficacy of his Goſpel Miniſtry in every place towards all ſorts of perſons; ſince he was the ſweet ſavour of God in Chriſt, in them that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in them that periſh, <hi>ver:</hi> 15, 16. Which occaſions him to touch upon the bad practice of many Teachers in his dayes, that corrupted or dealt deceitfully with the word of God, (as is the uſuall practice of ſuch as fight for the Dragon and his Angells againſt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angells) in oppoſition whereof he expreſſeth the ſinceritie of his own preaching as of God in the ſight of God in Chriſt, <hi>ver:</hi> the laſt.</p>
            <p>Now in the beginning of the Chapter he prevents an objection, as if he might ſeeme to be vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, or ſought his own praiſe, or needed teſtimony from any man, <hi>ver:</hi> 1. He declares againſt both from what was wrought by his Miniſtry upon the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> own ſouls, and what all men read and knew thereby, <hi>ver:</hi> 2. And ſhews that to be an Epiſtle of Chriſt in his behalfe written with the Spirit of the living God in the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41908:13"/>
Tables of their hearts, and that this was his great encouragement, <hi>ver:</hi> 3, 4. And then beating downe all ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging all his ſufficiency from God, <hi>ver:</hi> 5. From thence to my text he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a large compariſon of the New Teſtament Miniſtry with the Old in many particulars, which we ſhall only mention briefly, and ſo paſſe to the Text; As that the firſt was of the letter, the ſecond of the Spirit, <hi>ver:</hi> 6. The firſt was that that killeth, the ſecond that that giveth life, <hi>ver:</hi> 6. The firſt was written in Tables of ſtone, the ſecond in the fleſhie Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the heart, <hi>ver:</hi> 3. The firſt of the Old Teſtament, <hi>ver:</hi> 14. the ſecond of the New Teſtament, <hi>ver:</hi> 6. The firſt of that which was to be done away, the ſecond of that which remaineth, <hi>ver:</hi> 11. The firſt of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſecond of righteouſneſſe, <hi>ver:</hi> 9.

            <p>So that theſe words are an aſſertion of the clearneſs of the Goſpel miniſtration &amp; grace, in oppoſition to the obſcure vaile that was in the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               </gap>] <hi>But we all,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby what followes in the Text is brought in by way of diſſimilitude of what was found in <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtration, that whereas that was inglorious and dark in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this under the Goſpel, this is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; whence obſerve;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the diſcovery of the myſterie of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the New Teſtament, is a much more excellent and cleare diſcovery then what was under the Old Teſtament.</hi> Although God even in the Miniſtration of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament gave then unto his people what ever was neceſſary for the ſalvation of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he being no leſſe the Author of that then of what he hath ſince more clearely exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the New; and ſince the ſubſtance of the grace and ſalvation conferred upon all true beleevers, both then and ſince is the ſame; yea and the ſeverall ordinances (when he pleaſed) were <hi>aequè</hi> efficacious to the due attenders on them, though (happily) not <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualiter;</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41908:19"/>
yea ſince the Spirit of God gives an honour yea glory to them as ſuch in their ſeaſon, untill his moſt Soveraigne Authoritie laid them aſide, we may not deny it, unleſſe (as in the caſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of) they be ſiniſtrouſly perverted to Eclypſe the juſt glory of Goſpel grace; but as the account was given by the Ancients why the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was for a time obſerved together with the Chriſtian Sabbath: <hi>Quia vetus Synagoga cum honore erat ſepelienda:</hi> ſo of all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Old Teſtament in their cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; yea the Apoſtle in this Chapter though he juſtly aſcribes a greater glory to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the new, yet he acknowledgeth the due glory that was in the former, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; <hi>it was glorious,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ver:</hi> 7. yea <hi>glory</hi> in the abſtract, <hi>ver:</hi> 9. was made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>ver:</hi> 10.

in the 13 <hi>ver:</hi> ſpeaketh, he put a vaile, over his face for that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly look unto the end: yea this Miniſter of this Moral Law was all along glorious by eminent corruſcations of divine grace towards, in, upon, and by him; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfully delivered from killing and drowning, being a new-borne babe; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, honourably, liberally, and learnedly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in his youth, that as he in the old, and this our Apoſtle in the new Teſtament, might afford ſome honour unto ſuch ordinary helps under both adminiſtrations, according to their ſubordinate nature and uſe: But more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in him when he was carried with zeale and confidence to manifeſt himſelf eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Gods means to bring them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and ſo ſelfe-denying in ſuch a cauſe, that by the ſtrength of his faith, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb:</hi> 11. ſhews, <hi>That he refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharoahs daughter, and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to injoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon:</hi> And did not God doe as great things by him in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the red Sea, and in the Wilderneſſe, both before and in his Legal Miniſtration. But I may not here particularize, but leave it to abler pens, or more skilfull Pilots to ſteere
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41908:20"/>
that Ship in its right channel, with our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here to advance true Goſpel grace, though I muſt not forget the honour of his divine buriall after the manifeſtation of his humane frailtie, and that in ſuch a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and fatherly manner, admoniſhing and directing to the preparation thereof; <hi>Goe up to Mount Nebo and dye,</hi> (as if with <hi>David</hi> that other man after Gods own heart) he had been only to climbe up to the uſuall bed of repoſe: But as this penman, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that Law it ſelfe that he delivered, in the delivery of it ſeemeth to have in divers reſpects a Goſpel glory put upon it, to ſhew that Goſpel grace was then to make it up and perfect it, (becauſe otherwiſe it was weak by reaſon of ſin) and it to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Goſpel grace; whence may appeare that it was not a making a Covenant of works with the faithfull people of God, but an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of the old Covenant of works, in what it was weak to the promoting of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and excellency of the new Covenant of grace, and this will be further manifeſt; Firſt, in that God owns his people as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s, <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the Lord their God, according to the tenour of it. Secondly, in that he is ſaid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41908:20"/>
               <hi>to deliver them out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage;</hi> which myſtically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the ſpirituall deliverance out of the ſpirituall bondage of ſin and Satan, that he might wonderfully conduct them through the wilderneſſe of this troubleſome world, till he bring them to the poſſeſſion of the celeſtiall <hi>Canaan:</hi> And together with this Evangelicall delivery of the Law, he gave them many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances holding out and conveying unto the faithfull amongſt them his Goſpel grace by the Meſſiah that was to come: beſide, the glorious manner and familiar way of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them ſuch ſpirituall grace, <hi>talking with Moſes face to face, as a man talketh with his friend;</hi> all which may abundantly ſet forth (if duly weighed) the gloriouſneſſe of that grace, even in that miniſtration; but if we compare it with the clearneſſe, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the largeneſſe, the affecting efficacy of Goſpel grace now, we may ſay with our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>ver: 10. That which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</hi> And this is further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in many parts of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> where he treateth much of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but more eſpecially in the 9th Chapter of that Epiſtle, calling that (though it had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41908:21"/>
Ordinances of Divine ſervice, yet) a <hi>worldly Sanctuary,</hi> and paſſeth through many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whereby was myſtically held out divine and ſpiritual grace, from the firſt to the 9th verſe, where he tells them, <hi>That all this was but a figure for the time then preſent, untill the time of reformation,</hi> ver: 10. And thereupon takes advantage to advance the glory of more perfect &amp; greater Tabernacle, of which Chriſt was become an high Prieſt, <hi>by how much the blood of Chriſt was above the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the purging of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> above thoſe carnall Ordinances that only ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>ver:</hi> 13, 14. And ſo Chriſt <hi>is become the Mediator of a better Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led might receive the promiſe of eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> ver: 15. And ſo goes on largely to illuſtrate many particulars of the glorious grace of the new Teſtament above the old, as is obvious to the duly obſervant reader to diſcerne both in this and the following Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now for ſome further illuſtration of the point, let us a little take notice of ſome few
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41908:21"/>
particulars, wherein the excellency and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of New Teſtament Goſpel grace may further appeare; as if we conſider, that the firſt was the infancy or non-age of the Church, the ſecond, the more growne Age thereof, I do not ſay the perfect Age, as ſome miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken perſons fancy of themſelves, unleſſe they meane that perfection of inward ſinceritie; with ſuch perfect perſons God will (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) ſhew himſelfe perfect, <hi>Pſal:</hi> Now childiſh things agree beſt to an infant age, as comparatively the firſt were till as more ſuitable to a more growne eſtate God was pleaſed to put away ſuch childiſh things, and conſtitute others more agreeable thereunto; for his Church in this world is not of a dwarfiſh nature, but alwayes growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its more perfect ſtature. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Ordinances and ſervice of the firſt was much in ſhaddows and types, and conſequently leſſe diſcernable, leſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, but the ſecond more in realitie and ſubſtance, and therefore more knowne and more comfortable; for as things delightfull to the eye or outward ſenſes, doe not feed the body further then ſome ſecret nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may by them be conveyed unto it; ſo neither doe carnall and bodily reſemblances
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41908:22"/>
profit the ſoul, without Gods inſtitution and bleſſing upon them; who hath abundantly ſhewed that he hath reſerved the choyceſt of his glorious grace for more ſpirituall and better things: beſides the end of typicall worſhip is in a good degree perfected in the ſpirituall: but I muſt but touch on theſe things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, [That which depends upon the former] is in reſpect; the former was of old things that were to vaniſh away (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh) the other of things that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; a roſe or violet may be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to the ſenſes than a precious ſtone, whereas the excellency of the one is ſoone gone, but the vertue of the other will long continue, and accordingly they are prized by men, and ſo it is in things that concerne the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By the firſt were in a great meaſure denoted good things that were to come, but by the ſecond are held out good things that are preſent; a little good in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, is better then much (many times) in reverſion; <hi>Your fathers,</hi> ſaid our Saviour, <hi>deſired to ſee thoſe things that ye ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to heare thoſe things that ye heare, and have not heard them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41908:22"/>Fifthly, The firſt conſiſted much in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes, which little profit the ſoul in regard of any aptitude of their owne, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more of ſpirituall intendments of the ſoul, more ſuitable to the divine nature and revealed will of God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The firſt were ordinarily leſſe efficacious, and the ſpirituall grace ſeemed more reſtrained under them, but the ſecond have been many times more efficacious with the powerings out of the Spirit in a more plentifull manner, as was propheſied by <hi>Joel,</hi> Chap: 3. and promiſed by God, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and ſo along in after times.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The ordinary tenders of grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament were more reſtrained and circumſcribed within the bounds of the Jewiſh Church (unleſſe now and then ſome few Proſelytes came in) even our Saviour ſometime reſtrained his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Goe not into the way of the Gentiles, but goe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> for they were naturally the inheritours of the promiſes of Grace; <hi>untill</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>they put away the word of Eternall life from them.</hi> But when the old Synagogue was to ceaſe, the renders of Goſpel grace
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41908:23"/>
were abundantly inlarged; <hi>Goe Diſciple ye all Nations,</hi> Math: <hi>Preach the Goſpel to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature,</hi> Mark. Then ſhortly by a great ſheete (as it were) let down from heaven the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is taught <hi>to call no man common or uncleane,</hi> Acts 11. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our Apoſtle in thoſe noted compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the middle of this Chapter further obſerveth to theſe or ſuch like purpoſes, may hither be reduced. But I haſten to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, having ſtayed longer than I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the entrance into my Text.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To teach all good Chriſtians hence to learne to praiſe God for all this Goſpel mercy we injoy in this kinde, above what the Church of God did under the miniſtration of the Old Teſtament; theirs was much in the letter, ours more in the Spirit; theirs a killing letter, ours a life-giving grace; theirs in Tables of ſtone, ours in the fleſhie Tables of the hearts; theirs old, ours new; theirs to be done away, ours to remaine; theirs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ours of righteouſneſſe; theirs leſſe glorious, ours excelling in ſpirituall glory; theirs dark and obſcure, ours open and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; theirs burthenſome and grievous, ours eaſie and delightfull; and though in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the providence of God to them was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41908:23"/>
remarkable, for according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſacrifices, offerings, and coſtlineſſe of his ſervice then, he gave them a plentifull Land to ſupply them, according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of hazzard in attendance upon his worſhip three times in the yeare at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> he gave them ſecuritie by a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Exod:</hi> 34. 33, 34. and not only from the hands, but even from the hearts of ſuch enemies as were round about them, [a ſtrong engagement to all Gods people to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the ways of his own ſervice againſt all diſcouragements] againe theirs was more ſuitable to an Infant ſtate, ours more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a more growne eſtate; theirs much in type, ours more in ſubſtance; theirs denoted good things to come, ours good things that are preſent; theirs much in bodily exerciſes, ours mainly in ſpirituall; theirs ordinarily leſſe efficacious, ours uſually more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; theirs for the moſt part reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow bounds of that Jewiſh Church, ours largely extended to the utmoſt bounds of the true Chriſtian Catholique Church: Oh! did but Chriſtians duly weigh theſe things, and in ſome good meaſure were but ſuitably affected with them, according to the greatneſſe and excellency of the glorious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41908:24"/>
Goſpel grace in all ſuch reſpects vouchſafed by the free and aboundant goodneſſe of ſo glorious a God unto themſelves above what he was pleaſed to grant unto his ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Jewes;</hi> how ſhould it raiſe up their ſouls to large apprehenſions of his goodneſſe, and fill their hearts with ſtrong affections, and earneſt deſires and endeavours both of thankfulneſſe and obedience to his divine Majeſty! and how ſhould it ſet all the parts and powers of the inward and outward man on work to act both diligently and faithfully therein! how would this as a ſtrong cord binde our ſouls unto the right obſervance of the new Law of love given by him that hath purchaſed this libertie, and therefore ſhed it abroad into the hearts of his people, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. 5. that <hi>none of his Commandements might be grievous unto them,</hi> Joh: 3. 5.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, let this be as an impulſive motive to us to be anſwerable in our dutifull and faithfull obedience unto our gracious God and heavenly father, in reference to all that rich mercy that in this kinde particularly we receive at his hand, above many of thoſe that lived in thoſe darke dayes before us: now that his ſervice is more ſpirituall, let ours be more ſo too; as his is more cleare</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41908:24"/>[ſhaddowed and typicall ſervice being cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed] let ours be ſuitable to Goſpel light, and therein let us walk as children of that light; whereas the other was more agreeing to a childiſh ſtate, let us ſeek after that which is more ſuitable to a manly ſtate in Chriſt, <hi>Let us</hi> (as the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10. 22.) <hi>draw nigh with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes waſhed with pure water:</hi> It muſt be with the heart, elſe all ſeeming devotion is groſſe dotage, it muſt be from an heart fraught with all kinde of truth, a true heart, it muſt be in full aſſurance of faith, we muſt be ſufficiently warranted and ſatisfied in all that concerns it in all our performance of it, <hi>having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience;</hi> the guilt and power of ſin being taken from us by the improvement of our faith, ſpecially when we performe religious worſhip unto God; and our bodies waſhed with pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let not there be a purifying of the ſoul only, but let our outward converſation alſo be agreeing to the Goſpel in the ſight of God and men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hence likewiſe may appeare what great matter of deep humiliation and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41908:25"/>
bitter mourning there is in our dayes, that when ſuch bright beames of Goſpel glory ſhines before men, there is ſo little enters into many of all ſorts and conditions, which may appeare by the raritie of ſuch as ſhew they behold it, by their right knowledge of it, high prizing of it, walk in the light and comfort of it: improving the grace and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it, and by the multitude of ſuch as underſtand it not, regard it not, owne it not, improve it not, yea would it might not be truly ſaid, deſpiſe it, reſiſt it, oppoſe it, and would ſubſtitute any thing in the roome of it, rather then what the Spirit of God in the manifold evidences of Goſpel grace clearly directs unto; but I muſt haſten; therefore</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To warne all ſorts of men that live under ſuch glorious diſcoveries of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace, to beware that becauſe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Chriſt therein is light, that therefore they ſhould thinke lightly and ſlightly both of it and him; That they ſhould either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre tranſitory things before it, or conceive they can be happie enough in them without any true intereſt in it: or are not affected with this choice mercy afforded to us above what the Church in the Old Teſtament at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Thus if God would worke wonders by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> ſorcerers ſhall do ſo too; if God reveals ſecrets to <hi>Saul</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> muſt doe ſo too; if <hi>Judah</hi> have a coſtly Tabernacle and Temple, <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall have Golden Calves to worſhip: yea ſometimes outward and inward too, as in the Antichriſtian Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince that golden Prieſts and wooden Chalices were changed into wooden Prieſts and golden Chalices, with all other outward ſplendor in the whoriſh Idolatry and ſuperſtitions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an inward ſeeming humble devotion and reverence, with multitudes of prayers &amp; offerings frequent and macerating penances and pilgrimages, metorious works of charitie and pietie: And is not Satan his

crafts-maſter like wiſe, when in Goſpel times too, he will lay aſide an outward appearance of glory, to ſeek to delude by an appearing glory in inward ſtrong deluſions of ſpirituall Enthuſiaſmes, Raptures and Revelations (as a more plauſible way with ſome under the New Teſtament,) and among ſome by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawful &amp; comfortable uſe of outward good things, as meats, and decent apparel, and civil reſpect, with too much inſiſting upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial matters &amp; ſcruples in ſome things where God makes none, though of ſome things it may (haply) be ſaid, as our Saviour ſpake of the tything of Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin, <hi>Theſe things ye ought to doe, and not to leave the other undone;</hi> while cleare and manifeſt truths and duties are rejected and neglected.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the Text it ſelfe, the maine ſubject where of is that glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace ſo excellently many wayes deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered therein; and firſt by that excellent title the Spirit of God here aſcribeth to it, [<hi>The glory of the Lord</hi>] whence after ſome ſhort explication of the words premiſed, our Firſt Obſervation was;</p>

Proceed we then to the proofe and illuſtration of the poynt, which Firſt may appeare that the excellent title of Glory is ſo often aſcribed in holy Scripture to the grace of God, that they are often put one for another, as by comparing this Text with others may be evident in 40 <hi>Chap:</hi> of <hi>Iſa:</hi> ver: 5.

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41908:28"/>Firſt, We ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that it hath been the great deſigne of God to glorifie himſelfe by Goſpel grace, from the beginning of the world, yea from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto all eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he hath been, is, and will be more glorious in the eyes of all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people by this, then by any other or all other his glorious workes beſides, whereby he hath any wayes diſcovered his glory in the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that by means of this only, men are made capable of glory, and true glory made truly glorious in their eyes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that Goſpel grace and celeſtiall glory, differ not in nature, but in degrees, and the firſt ſhall be perfected in the other, when grace ſhall be ſwallowed up of glory..</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that from this Goſpel grace, ſhall be infinite cauſe for all glorified Saints and Angels, to celebrate the glory of the Lord to all eternitie: all which being done, I hope it may ſufficiently appeare, how emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpel grace in the Text is ſtiled <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that it hath been the great deſigne of God by ſuch Goſpel grace to glorifie himſelfe from all eternity, is not only cleare
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41908:29"/>
from all ſuch Scriptures as ſpeak any thing in reference to that grace as eternall [<hi>a parte ante</hi>] for what is paſt: as that Chriſts blood was ſhed, and that he <hi>offered himſelfe unto God through the eternall Spirit,</hi> Heb: 9. 14. and that the Goſpel is called <hi>the everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> Rev: 14. 6. But we have a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Gods great deſigne herein from all eternity, plainly ſet down by the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph: 3. who having minded them in the former part of the Chapter, that the myſtery of the Goſpel was by revelation made knowne to him, and that he ſhould be the Miniſter thereof to the Gentiles; and as <hi>ver:</hi> 9. that they might ſee what is the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the myſtery which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world had been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, [who is the beginning of the creation of God, <hi>Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 3. 18.] But <hi>ver;</hi> 10. he more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly informeth them, that the intent was not only that the manifold wiſdome of God ſhould be known to the Church, but by the Church unto Angels, <hi>unto principalities and powers in heavenly places;</hi> and <hi>ver:</hi> 11. he ſets forth as clearly, the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this diſplaying of ſuch glory is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; according to the eternall purpoſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41908:29"/>
which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; read the place, it is full to our purpoſe. Now that this hath been Gods deſigne [<hi>a parte poſt</hi>] likewiſe unto all eternity, I ſhall need to ſay little; the current of the Goſpel runs directly in that channel: <hi>Chriſt is the Author of eternall ſalvation,</hi> Heb: 5. 9. <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> 1 Tim: 12. <hi>Eternall glory,</hi> 2 Tim: 2. 10. Now Gods deſigne in this is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Eph: 1. 12. That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And again, <hi>ver:</hi> 14. after many excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries he adds, <hi>unto the praiſe of his glory:</hi> And now we have a little taken notice of the foundation and drift of Gods great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in his Church; let us likewiſe a little obſerve, how ever ſince he had a Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth he hath carried it on: Firſt, as God had decreed to make his eternall Goſpel (as it were his maſterpelce) to manifeſt his greateſt glory to all eternity, ſo he hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully glorified himſelfe in the Goſpel of grace ever ſince the world and time had a being, and as the contemporary myſtery of God was in fulfilling, as it's called, <hi>Rev:</hi> 10. 7.</p>
            <p>So that ſo ſoon as the Arch-murtherer from the beginning, thought he had given the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41908:30"/>
dead ſtroake to mankinde, by ſeducing our firſt parents from their obedience to God, God himſelfe, when there was no other prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, ordained to doe it by an Hell-aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfull declaration of moſt free and rich grace toward loſt man; even whilſt he denounced againſt the Devill his own doom, he pronounceth in thoſe great and ingratefull tranſgreſſors own hearing, the maine diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Goſpel grace, viz. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> and though it was by a new grace whereby the efficie of that good newes muſt be applyed, yet he had taught them ſuch means to waite upon him, wherein his ſervants ſhould not faile to obtaine grace and acceptance with him: and this was ſeen in <hi>Abels</hi> offering, when though he parted from that vaine life that ſin before had forfeited, yet ſince his perſon and Sacrifice were accepted with God, through that ſeed of the woman promiſed not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his immediate parents, he not only received the firſt fruits, but the firſt &amp; ſpeedy poſſeſſion of the benefit of that eternall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſo lately declared by the eternall God himſelfe, and therefore obtained the honour of the Protomartyr of the whole world, and of a true type of the Long expected Meſſiah,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41908:30"/>
and of that bleſſed ſeed that was to come now what a cleare evidence of Goſpel grace in a ſhort time was here ſet forth from the beginning, to be known and read of all men! and did not God raiſe up in ſucceſſion emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons adorned with grace to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and patterns of piety unto men, and with his Spirit move them, untill, as even wearied by their contumacy, God would not have his Spirit ſtrive any longer with them? and then Satan, as if he had gotten a totall and finall conqueſt, like a wild horſe with the bridle-bit between his teeth, runs on in ſo full a carreire, with the world upon his back, towards Hell, that by reaſon of his intereſt he had formetly gotten in mans nature, and had likely ſo improved that the old world ſoone became ſo much his, that it could be no longer Gods; And therefore God will rather out of the ſeed and familie of <hi>Noah</hi> alone, raiſe up to himſelfe a new Church, and make their ſaving in the Arke (even at that time of Satans ſeeming prevailing power) to be an evident type unto all the faithfull, of their certain deliverance and ſafetie in the time of the wicked worlds worſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and deſtructions. And as the time of the coming of the promiſed Seed drew near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41908:31"/>
God more and more cauſed ſome beames of his glory to ſhine out in his Church, for the comfort of his faithfull ſervants.

by this in his Church in this life: For ſhould I ſpeak but of thoſe reſemblances in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Spirit of God ſheweth, but to ſhaddow out unto our weak ſight the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant beams of ſpiritual Goſpel glory, the expreſſions will appear much below the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though in themſelves they be very high; as namely, the hidden <hi>Manna, The water of life for food; yea the fat things and pleaſures of Gods houſe, the marrow and fatneſs there, and wines on the lees well refined,</hi> (Iſa. 25. 6.) <hi>for their feaſting; eye ſalve for medicine to make them ſee,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. <hi>App'es and Flaggons to keep them from ſounding; Balme and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from Gilead; Gold tried in the fire to make them rich garments of needlework; and wrought gold with jewels to adorn them; white rayment to make them pure; the white ſtone with the new name written in it, that none can read but they that have it, to ſecure their intereſt,</hi> Rev. 2. 17. with others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are ſpoken to the capacity of other men; but what the inward efficacy and glory of theſe things is, is only rightly and really known to ſuch as have them: by this inward work of God upon mens Souls, a truly glorious change is wrought in them; of Bond-ſlaves under Sin, and children of Satan,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41908:34"/>
they are made free indeed, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea, <hi>the Image of God is reſtored in them, and they are partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. Their Souls are made Temples of the holy One, where God the Father vouchſafes his preſence, Chriſt holds his Soveraignty, and the Holy Ghoſt his Reſidence; and hereby they have Communion with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: by which means, great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, great conſolations, and great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto ſuch poor Souls upon all good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions from time to time, are happily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, untill from ſtrength to ſtrength in grace here, they be by the Almighty power and grace of God their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brought into poſſeſſion of the fulneſs of glory with himſelf in the higheſt heavens, there with all the Celeſtial Angels, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Saints, ſing forth their <hi>Halelujahs</hi> to the eternall praiſe of his infinitely great, and glorious name.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, we have ſeen it hath been the deſign of God, by Goſpel grace to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelf, &amp;c. So let us now conſider that he hath been, is, and will be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of all his people by this Goſpel grace, then by any other, or all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41908:35"/>
other his glorious works beſides, whereby he hath any wayes diſcovered his glory in the world. Now that we may at leaſt repreſent ſome glimpſe of this ſpiritual glory in ſome meaſure ſutable to what it is unto mens Souls, we ſhall by the gracious aſſiſtance of God indeavour to tender it in this enſuing method. Firſt, to offer ſome conſiderations of the glorious works of God in Creation, Suſtentation, and Gubernation of all things in the world. Secondly, to tender ſome repreſentations of the more glorious works of his Goſpel grace diſplayed in his Church in the world. Thirdly, to ſhew ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conſiderations, wherein this work is more glorious then any, yea, then all the other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath by all the three former great and glorious works preached unto loſt mankind, how great, and how good, and how powerfull he is, as <hi>Pſ. 19. 1, 2, 3. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſheweth his handy work. Day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to day uttereth ſpeech: night unto night ſheweth knowledge. There is no ſpeech nor language where their voice is not heard.</hi> And though that his preaching to them hath been very clear, loud, and conſtant, yet uſually
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41908:35"/>
they have lent either a deaf or a negligent ear thereunto, they would either not heare, or not regard it.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, of Creation, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a clear evidence, <hi>Ro. 1. 20. The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, ſo that they [viz.</hi> the Gentiles] <hi>are without excuſe.</hi> That his power was infinite, the nature of the work doth ſhew, ſince only an infinite power can create, that is, make ſomething, any thing, all things, out of nothing; that he could make them without pains, labour, or trouble; and that he could with the ſame facility make multitudes of worlds if he pleaſed, as well as one.</p>
            <p>That his Wiſdom was wonderful therein, was manifeſt in the manner, order, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the work, ſo to command creatures to be ſo ſucceſſively in their order, to ſupply in their uſes the wants of each other, ſo to diſpoſe of their nature, qualities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, uſes, as in Storehouſes to Treaſure up all their ſeveral vertues and benefits; and yet ſo as to have them communicable for all their ſeveral due intendments and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41908:36"/>
purpoſes; and yet this work ſo vaſt, ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yea, not only in the want of order in things before, but in want of being of things to be ordered, doth abundantly publiſh the wiſdome of the maker and diſpoſer of them.</p>
            <p>His goodneſs in that work is as largely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; for they were not only good as God firſt made them, and his word witneſſed of them, but even he filled (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) with his goodneſs every living thing, and to make them in their ſeveral courſes as ſo many conduit pipes of goodneſs to all ſorts of creatures in the world, and by all theſe wayes, and in what ever reſpect elſe the world was capable, to have diſcovered his wonderful glory unto it, in a work of Creation.</p>
            <p>Now Secondly, for the work of Suſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>he upholds all things by the word of his power;</hi> that is in him, no leſs great, no leſs wonderful and glorious then the other: All Creatures had no more power to preſerve themſelves of others in the State God hath made them, or preſerved them, then they had to make themſelves at firſt, or one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did not he as well communicate a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41908:36"/>
ſupport to them in their Being, comforte &amp; operations continually, as well as at their firſt ſubſiſtance: Creatures may by his order adde an accidental form to Gods matter, but God by his glorious work of Suſtentation, by the ſame efficatiouſneſs wherewith at firſt he made all Creatures in their kinds, keeps all, both their matter and eſſential forms together; to which purpoſe, the Apoſtle in that excellent diſcourſe of his (<hi>Acts.</hi> 17. 24.) of all theſe temporal works of God, brings in this forcible reaſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. in ſome ſort acknowledged by very heathens: <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> If God ſhould but withhold his powerful ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from any or all Creatures in the world, they would ſuddenly be reſolved into their firſt nothing. For what is the order, or courſe, or ſtrength of nature in all ſorts of Creatures, but what God firſt aſſigned to them, and ever ſince at his pleaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth in them, but altereth when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; the Soul muſt needs guide and act the body, as God appointeth it, while it ſtayes therein, becauſe a natural agent, but God as a free and voluntary agent, can withdraw his ſupport and actings from the Creatures, or ſtop them as he pleaſeth; But now to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41908:37"/>
conſider, that in an ordinary way of ſupport, God hath held up the whole Creation for now allmoſt 6000. years in the whole, and all the main ſubſtantial parts of it, and that in ſo ſtrangly different manners and wayes. The great Ball of the Earth, to our underſtanding, hangs upon nothing, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with its own weight; the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us that <hi>God hath founded it upon the floods. Pſ.</hi> 24. 2. Yea, but the waters and the earth are two heavy bodies, that now make up one Globe; and there is nothing contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them but the thin adflitting penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ayre, wherewith they are incompaſſed round about: and yet this Globe ſtands ſo firmly, that it cannot be moved, <hi>Pſal. 93. 1. &amp;</hi> 96. 10. In both which places, the Holy Spirit would have men know from this, that God raigneth: yet the principles moveable, the parts moveable, all things in it and upon it continual changeable, and moveable, and have been for ſo many thouſand years, and yet the foundation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains immoveable, not of its own nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at the pleaſure of him that upholds it; and that after all the tranſactings, concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſucceſſions, intercourſes and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the earth, ſince the firſt Creation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41908:37"/>
of it, yet thoſe foundations are never the more ſhaking, never the more tottering, worne or decayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all this time the upper part of this world, the material heavens, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in a contrary courſe, in a ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable ſeemingly violent circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and turning about, wonderfully conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, even for the preſervation, uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all ſorts of Creatures in the inferior Orbe, which I can now only hint at, (being not my direct buſineſs in hand) yet thoſe heavens are as much unworn with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though ſo quick, ſo conſtant; ſo fracil as much unwearied or unweakned with their work and influence, ſo great, ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo long continued; as much unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in their beauty, in their glory, in their as primarie excellencie, though they have been as long invected with it: So that by this little touch of this matter we may ſee that there is a wonderful glory in Gods work of Suſtentation and upholding the world.</p>
            <p>His third glorious work in the world, which is no leſs wonderful and powerful, namely, his Gubernation and ruling thereof; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, if we had but eyes to ſee, and underſtandings to conceive aright,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41908:38"/>
wiſdome to diſcern, memories to retain, and faith to beleeve as we ought ro do, what God hath done in his moſt Soveraign Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations in the world, ever ſince it had a being; not in ſmaller things, but in the greateſt; not in ſome things, but in all things; not at ſometime only, but at all times moſt powerfully fulfilling his own word, even in the moſt unſteadie things, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 148. 8. <hi>Fire and hail, ſnow and vapour, ſtormy wind, they all fulfill his word,</hi> moſt irreſiſtably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompliſhing his own purpoſe, moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly fulfilling his own counſel, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably eſtabliſhing all his decrees, in all things, fully, perfectly, irreſiſtably fulfilling all his own pleaſure in all things paſt, preſent, or to come, ordinary or extraordinary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be, whether natural or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, voluntarie or unwilling, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or unreaſonable, they are all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, conſtituted, regulated, actuated, inſtruments, and inferior agents by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with, under, or from others, in what way ſoever they work, or by what means ſoever they are acted, it is all to fulfil his holy, juſt, wiſe, and good pleaſure, and that infallibly through all the world; though ſome ſelf-will adorers, and Reaſon-admirers,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41908:38"/>
either for the want of true faith, or at leaſt the due improvement of it, (as is to be feared) to their own prejudice, and others inſnarement, do not fully acknowledge all this, becauſe by their own principles they cannot reach it; but why ſhould little Cives expect to contain the whole Ocean? the works of Gods glorious Gubernation, are a great altitude, never ſufficiently to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by humane capacity; they are a great deepe, no reach of underſtanding creatures can fathome them; his pathes are every where, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> faith; in the ſeas, in the ayre, in the heavens, in the earth, amongſt men, and amongſt devills; and yet his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps are not known, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> goes on: how glorious then would this work of God (being duly weighed) appear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for we muſt not now inlarge upon it, but proceed to our main work, which is the ſecond thing we mentioned to be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, <hi>viz.</hi> To tender ſome glimpſes of Gods more glorious work of Goſpel grace diſplayed in his Church in the world, though all the other are very glorious in their kind and order, ſuch as are agreeing to the wonderful excellencie of the infinite and moſt glorious God, yet in the glory of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41908:39"/>
Goſpel grace, it ſhines out more eminently then in all the other: ſome may by the view of a weak ſighted diſcoverer, be pointed out to ſee much more, then otherwiſe, that undiſcovered to them, they might have obſerved, and being in the way may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover much more; children and weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons where they know the way, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times well direct ſtrong and skilful travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers advantageouſly in their journey.</p>
            <p>Should we proceed to ſpeak of this Glory of the Lord, it is the wonder of wonders, the miracle of miracles, the greateſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of men and angels, in the greateſt perfection of their underſtanding and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which, for which, and by which, God will everlaſtingly be admired, adored, and magnified by all of them, that ſhall be bleſſed to all eternity; you heard before, it was not only Gods deſign, through all time, but likewiſe his eternal purpoſe before time was, and when time ſhall ceaſe to be; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto this, not only a counſel of the bleſſed Trinity of perſons, in the Unitie of of the divine eſſence, is, not only called, but moſt wonderfully, gloriouſly, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully manifeſted, exerciſed more and more, ſo that never any thing in the world appeared
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41908:39"/>
comparable to it. It is for ordinary perſons to make a uſeful medicine of wholſome and good ingredients, but it ſhews the skill of an expert and learned Phyſitian, out of moſt dangerous poyſons and minerals, and the like, to compound a forcible reſtorative in a ſeemingly deſperate cure; ſo it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to created capacities, to conceive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of the outward works of God; but how to conceive of ſuch a work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, much more to contrive it, and moſt of all to accompliſh it, was unſpeakably above them. When man that was made little lower then the Angels, and crowned with glory and worſhip, and all things put in ſubjection under his feet, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> excellently, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 8. When God had put him into poſſeſſion of a whole world, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the comfortable uſe of all good things, given him dominion over all the creatures in it, had Gods Image upon him, might have near communion with him, and had his favour towards him, which would have been the very life of his then living Soule; that then ſuch a perſon at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch an enemy, upon ſuch ſlight ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, for a purpoſe ſo vain &amp; booteleſs, in a caſe that might appear ſo deſperately
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41908:40"/>
dangerous, and of which he was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forewarned by God himſelf, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed againſt it by a terrible threatning, which was wretchedly and wofully turned into a moſt ſad propheſie; and all this to the great diſhonor of ſo gracious a Creator, ſo bountiful a God and Father: Now had not God in this caſe wrought ſalvation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; none would, none could, none durſt, none knew how to go about the work: now therefore there is a way for a glorious Trinity, in a unity of eſſence, moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and gloriouſly to manifeſt it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face, and in the behalf of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, men and Angels; when the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God had been ſo robbed of all that glory due to him, by that great and good work of his Creation, he will now take occaſion more wonderfully, and more graciouſly, yea, moſt wonderfully and moſt graciouſly to diſcover himſelf unto his formerly, ſo excellent, and ſo happy, but now ſo vile and ſo miſerable depraved creature, as a Father, not only unthought of, but alſo altogether unſought for, by a moſt powerful work of redemption, and reſtauration; and in this, each of the three moſt glorious perſons, in the moſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41908:40"/>
holy and moſt bleſſed Trinity, doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf in his own peculiar, moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, gracious, and moſt glorious work: God the Father reveales himſelf in a way of relation to his natural and only begotten Son, that by a free grace then revealed, but long after to be accompliſhed by him, he might, to man his now loſt creature, again become his Father through grace: The ſon of God as a mediatour betwixt God and man, is a middle perſon, betwixt both, and having on him the natures both of God and man, that he might remove thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition walls of the infinite wrath of God on the one ſide, and the ſtayn and guilt and power of the ſin of loſt man on the other hand, he offers himſelf as a propitiatorie ſacrifice for man, to appeaſe thereby his Fathers wrath againſt him, and reſtore him into a State of grace: And that ſuch his goodneſs might not be caſt away, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conferred by Creation upon him was, God the Father, and the Son will ſend the holy Spirit, who proceeds from both, by whoſe all-powerful efficacious grace, that moſt glorious manifeſtation of God the Fathers incomprehenſible goodneſs towards loſt man, and that moſt gracious manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41908:41"/>
of God, the ſons moſt tender love and compaſſion towards loſt man, this work of ſalvation ſhould be irreſiſtably and moſt effectually carried on, by informing the mind, reforming the will, conforming his heart and ſoul to the will of God, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole man in his reformed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all this by bringing home this goſpel diſcovery of the Glory of the Lord, ſpoken of in the Text, and by that his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar work and undertaking, as we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by the aſſiſtance of the ſaid Lord the ſpirit, in due time to ſhew from the laſt words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Now according to this three-fold mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the glory of the Lord, from the beginning have all the moſt glorious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the grace of God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, ever ſince been derived, revealed, communicated, applyed, preſerved, conſerved, rewarded in the ſouls and perſons of all Gods faithfull ſervants in all Ages, and ſo will be to the end of the world: and was but mens Religion ſetled upon this foundation of Gods own laying, and ſteered in a right courſe to his own end, that as all grace is from himſelfe, ſo the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof might be given to him alone;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41908:41"/>
how might the Church of God be ſetled in truth and peace? But let us a little view the moſt radiant beames of this incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love, this ſupernatural grace, this divine Glory of God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, as from time to time they are darted out of Heaven, and powerfully ſent home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſouls of poore ſinners upon earth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reflexions of thoſe radiant beames in and upon thoſe poor ſinners ſouls; for I ſpeak not here of thoſe cloſe ſtopped bottles, that will ſuffer no good liquor to fall into them, though much fall upon them; yea, though caſt into a ſea of water, yet none can enter, becauſe they are cloſe ſtopt up; or ſuch dark Lanthorns that receive no light, though they be ſet in the bright Sun-ſhine at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: but of ſuch, as like burning or looking glaſies, in the beholding of this glory, as in the Text, receive from the Sunne of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ſhines moſt gloriouſly in their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere only, as the light of old did in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen,</hi> when thick darkneſſe was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (I ſay) from him both light and heate and brightneſſe, <hi>and are transformed into the ſame Image.</hi> Where ſhould I begin to ſpeak of the glory of their transfiguration? or when ſhould I make an end? Look upon their birth,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41908:42"/>
it is celeſtiall, it is divine, it is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] it is from above, it is from God, ſo they are not only a truly noble or Royall, which the vaine world is apt too much to prize alone, but they are alſo a reall divine Race, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. But this glory of theirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Queens Daughter, is mainly within, this ſpirituall life of theirs <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. With this new birth and life is conveyed a divine and ſpiritual illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into their ſouls, with this is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjoyned a particular ſpiritual applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every ſacred truth, by that illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſcovered out of the word of God, by any means, whereby God ſets it before them; from this application proceedeth love, which labours to manifeſt it ſelfe in an affectionate conſtant endeavour of all due thankfulneſſe and obedience to his divine Majeſtie, in the improvement of all grace received, and all gracious diſpoſitions and affections, and in the performance of all duties toward God and man; and ſo when the holy Spirit hath taken poſſeſſion, Chriſt ſits regent in all their ſouls, where he hath a ſpiritual and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdome, of which there ſhall be no end; whoſe Subjects ſhall never be traytors, nor revolters from his Divine Majeſtie;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41908:42"/>
bribes ſhall not allure them, terrours ſhall not fray them, they are ſworne feodaries to him, and will approve themſelves his liedg Subjects; their Rule and Law is Gods word, their Strength is his grace and joy, their Teacher and counſeller and comforter is his ſacred Spirit, their Tower of defence and rock is the rock of Ages, their Guard the holy Angells, their Annuitie or portion the good of the earth, the ayre, the Seas, here in their non-age; their preſent inheritance, the grace of God, the favour of God, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar providence of God, the promiſes of God, the Covenant of God, with all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of redemption purchaſed for them by that infinite ranſome of the blood of Chriſt, needfull for them in their pilgrimage here on earth, till they enter the poſſeſſion of the heavenly and eternal Kingdome of Glory.</p>
            <p>And this conſtant courſe of glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace, God the Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit, have manifeſted and magnified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, to the true and inviſible Church, throughout all generations to this very day, (though in different manners and degrees) and ſtill will doe ſo to the end of the world; and this glory of the Lord is ſo great in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41908:43"/>
eyes of true believers, that if all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of temporal glory, not only of the Kings and Kingdoms of the world, but the Glory of the Sunne Moone and Starres, were united into one, it would ſeeme to them obſcure and contemptible in compariſon of this: and ſo full of ſound comfort is their intereſt in this glorious grace, that were they offered the wealth, the pleaſure, the honour, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men, the confluence of all the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth of the world, without this they would (in their right temper) refuſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them all, as an incompetent offer; yea faithfull <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Martyrs in their times, would rather chuſe to ſuffer affliction with the people of God to injoy this, than to have the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; for oh the pearleſs worth of their ſecret, but certain injoyment of the favour of God, their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red intereſt in Chriſt, the guidance, the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving grace, his grace-working Ordinances, the ſpiritual pleaſures of his houſe, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelfe, the ſatisfaction, the ſecuritie, the ſoul-raviſhments of his love, with the reflections thereof, their love againe to his Divine Majeſtie, that twofold righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſts imputed, and theirs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41908:43"/>
               <hi>that peace of conſcience that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth underſtanding, that joy in the holy Ghoſt unſpeakeable and glorious, in which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven doth conſiſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Rom:</hi> 14. 17. The Glory indeed of this Kingdome is not diſcerned, but by the ſpiritual eye of faith; the happineſle thereof is not injoyed, but in the particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a truly believing ſoul; herein Chriſt ſhews wonders among the dead, as himſelfe ſo ſtrongly aſſerteth, <hi>Joh: 5. 25. Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, the houre is coming, and now is, that the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare ſhall live.</hi> Hereby Chriſt gaines a ſoveraigntie above all that is called God, as the Father promiſed, <hi>Pſal: 2. 8. He hath the heathen for his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion;</hi> neither can he be deprived of his Subjects, <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt them;</hi> no not of the weakeſt by the ſtrongeſt, none ſhall be able to pull any one ſheep from his fold; for hereby the ſoul of a converted ſinner is inſeparably united unto him. By this Goſpel grace the taſte and diſcerning of divine and ſpiritual things, is made truly cordial and comfortable unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſouls; Hereby God is ſet up in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41908:44"/>
higheſt place in the ſoul, in all he reveals himſelfe to be; Hereby he is ſought unto for all, acknowledged in all, what ever means or inſtruments he uſeth, believed in all he ſaith, honoured in all he doth, in proſperitie or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, in particular or in general, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, praiſe returned unto him for all mercies, how or what way ſo ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, feared above all, rejoyced in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in above all that can be conceived of creatures, incomparably: This makes them meaſure all Glory by Gods Standard, and weigh all comfort in Gods Ballance, and try all treaſure by Gods Touchſtone, and none of theſe will be approved by them, but what hath his allowance: Hereby God overcomes darkneſſe with light, corruption with ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, trouble with comfort, diſquiet with peace, ſorrow with joy, oppoſition with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, weakneſſe with ſtrength, aſſaults with victory, danger with ſecuritie, ſufferings with reſcue, death with life, and this not only once but often, not ſometime only but at all times, not in ſome reſpects only but in all, not againſt ſome evills only but againſt all, not for ſome continuance only but unto the end; for though every way <hi>many be the troubles of the righteous, yet the Lord delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41908:44"/>
them out of them all,</hi> Pſal: 34. 19. And all this grace, in all the varietie of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manifeſtations thereof, is in the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Chap: 4. ver:</hi> 4. And in the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>v:</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>And now in the third place, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtration of this greateſt glory of the Lord, manifeſt to his Church in this world, let us come to thoſe reſpective conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, wherein it will be yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this Goſpel glory is the greateſt glory of all that in the world God hath, or doth, or will manifeſt, yea or any living in it can behold.</p>
            <p>Now for manifeſtation of the many more glorious excellencies of Goſpel grace, above all the other glorious works of the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, wherein he hath diſcovered his wonderfull excellencies in, and for his true Church upon earth, as revealed, carried on, to be accompliſhed here, and fully perfected in heaven.</p>
            <p>We ſhall further endeavour by his moſt gracious aſſiſtance, to diſplay the tranſcendent glory of this work above all the other, in theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the more glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41908:45"/>Secondly, In reſpect of the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter of the work.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the many wayes conſiderably more excellent foundation of the work.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In reſpect of the moſt glorious ſtructure, forme, and frame of the work.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In regard of the long continued time for the raiſing of the work.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In regard of the way of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this work, by the conſtant ſhining out of the wonderfull glory of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, all the time it is in raiſing.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In reſpect of the ſubordinate means of raiſing up this work.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, In reſpect of the object for which, and in reference to whom, it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately contrived and raiſed.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, In regard of the ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is contrived, carried on, raiſed, and to be perfected in reference both to God and Man.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, In reſpect of the many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſes to be made by all men here, of the contriving, carrying on, and raiſing of this work, and what will be made of it by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints and Angells hereafter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41908:45"/>Eleventhly, In reſpect of the effect of all that concerns the manifeſtation of all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe of this work to good and bad men, and Angells, here and hereafter: And if <hi>the Lord the Spirit</hi> ſhall be graciouſly pleaſed, to carry us along in any competent manner, but to hint or point out unto any Arts of men, the manifold tranſcendent glory of this Goſpel <hi>glory of the Lord,</hi> I hope ſome men, by his bleſſing, may have the transforming glory thereof, if not altogether wrought, yet in ſome meaſure increaſed in them by the ſame Spirit, by whoſe guidance as we endeavour to doe it, ſo we ſhall endeavour to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore; of the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conſideration of the more glorious nature of the work, above the nature of the works of Creation, Suſtentation, and Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Providence; which though they be the Works of the All-glorious God, in their kinde and degree ſuitable to the Author, yet is this more excellent worke of his in its own nature eminently many wayes much more glorious, and particularly in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that the Creation, Suſtentation, &amp; Gubernation of the world, are of corruptible
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41908:46"/>
principles and materialls in continuall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations and changes, generations and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, increaſes and decreaſes, all in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, nothing in continuance or ſtability, excepting Angells, and the ſouls of men, which though they be in the world, <hi>yet they are not of the world,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not of, which in great part they are; but the great work of Goſpel grace is of a ſpiritual and incorruptible nature, ſuitable to the Author of it; and as the nature of a thing is neerer to him, the more perfect it is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All the former great works of God reſpect inferiour creatures, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beeing and well-fare of man, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reach no further; but this reſpects the inward and ſpiritual well-fare of man, and tends directly to the advancing of that; now as the uſe and improvement of a thing is more excellent and glorious, much more is that which is the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the firſt works conſiſted of corruptible principles, ſo their continuance and uſe will be but for a time, and ſhall have their periods and ceſſations; but this divine Goſpel grace is of an eternall being, and will remaine in its uſe and excellency to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41908:46"/>Secondly, And as in reſpect of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the work, ſo this Goſpel grace is more glorious than all the other in reſpect of the matter of the work. Baſe and mean mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls doe obſcure, and not illuſtrate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a work; <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, not one.</hi> God put at firſt a living ſoul into a body made of clay, but the body did not thereby become of the ſame excellency with the living ſoul: but this work of Goſpel grace hath ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is of a divine wonderfull and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible excellency, which we muſt not underſtand [<hi>Materiam ex qua,</hi> as in worldly things, but <hi>circa quam</hi>] not corporeall, but notional and intellectual, not matter <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè</hi> but <hi>objectivè,</hi> as the Schools diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; that is to ſay, the matter of this work is ſo conceived, rather in reſpect of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, than the realitie of the thing, which is beyond meaſure glorious.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But to come to the third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, wherein it is more glorious than all the other fore-named works, and that is in the many wayes conſiderably more excellent foundation of this work: the more wiſely, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly, and ſurely, any great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hath its foundation layd, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41908:47"/>
it addeth to it; and if this be not provided duly for, the greater the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the more hazzard, the more coſt and labour, the greater diſappointment and loſſe; Hence becauſe warre is a great undertaking by men, therefore ſaith One, <hi>With good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice make warre.</hi> Now the gloriouſneſſe of Gods laying the foundation of this work, will appeare greater than of all the other, in theſe particulars following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The foundation of this is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and more deeply layd than of all the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it is more ſecretly and hiddenly layd, than of all the other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it was a more difficult foundation to be layd in ſeverall reſpects, than of all the other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In that it is a foundation more ſurely layd, than of all the other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The commendation of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a foundation, is, as it is layd in the due proportion to the greatneſſe of the work undertaken, whereof it is the foundation; now the greatneſſe of Gods work in decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revealing, carrying on, and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glorious work of grace, is infinitely excellent in all dimenſions, intenſive, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41908:47"/>
yea beyond all dimenſions, mentall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, eternally infinite, which cannot be ſaid of any or all his other works, as may thus be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that this moſt glorious work was not undertaken for them, but contrarily, they were all undertaken and are carryed on for this, they were and are but the <hi>Subſtrata</hi> for this, and it is their greateſt excellency, that their beeing is in reference unto this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that this moſt glorious work is not ſubſervient unto them, but they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto it, ever ſince their firſt beginning, and muſt be ſo untill they ceaſe to be: God makes uſe of all his inferiour actings in the world amongſt all ſorts of creatures in all times, as ſubſervient one way or other to this glorious Grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that they, or any, or all of them, are not the end of this moſt glorious work, but contrarily this is the very end, every way chiefly conſiderable, wherefore they were or may be done hereafter, it is their <hi>finis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; operantis,</hi> it is their <hi>finis intentionis &amp; durationis,</hi> that is, this is the end they were done for, the end why God did them, he purpoſed them for this, and no longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for this, <hi>viz.</hi> till this great myſtery
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41908:48"/>
of God ſhould be finiſhed, as in <hi>Rev:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The next particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which we named in the excellency of Gods laying the foundation of this moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work, is the ſecrecy of it, it is an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den foundation; this follows in ſome ſort from the other, yet all foundations that are deep are not ſecret, they may be ſearched out, they may be diſcovered, they may be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they may be inlightened; but this was a ſecret hidden in Gods own counſell alone, when all the other foundations were open to men and Angells; yea this was not nor could be known, till himſelfe made it knowne, nor any further, then as he was pleaſed from time to time to cauſe it to be further known by men or Angells, and only rightly known to thoſe good men, to whom he himſelfe and his holy Spirit are pleaſed to reveal it, and make it known unto: and it is not only in generall in that reſpect of the great myſtery of God, but in reſpect of particular perſons; all men know not in this ſenſe the <hi>great myſtery of Godlineſſe,</hi> nor the <hi>myſtery of the kingdome of Heaven,</hi> though they often heare it and heare of it, but they only <hi>to whom it is given, Mar:</hi> 4. 11. Yea to all others the myſtery of God, and the myſtery of Godlineſſe, are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41908:48"/>
myſteries indeed, <hi>hidden from their eyes:</hi> And hence things peculiar to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are ſaid thus to be hidden, they have an <hi>hidden life with Chriſt in God, the hidden Manna, the name in the white ſtone, that none can reade but he that hath it,</hi> Rev: 2. 17. Hidden waters of life, drawn by the ſecret hand of faith out of the Rock Chriſt; they have the <hi>hidden man of the heart, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God,</hi> 1. Pet: 3. 4. And yet all theſe, though they be hidden from the world, are well known to them: and herein God wonderfully glorifies himſelfe in his moſt wiſe counſells, that the ſecret iſſues of them cannot be diſcovered by any enemies, though he ſees all their ſecret and fooliſh counſells to the contrary, and laughs them to ſcorne in all things, for he hath determined to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them all in all they mainly drive at; and what ever devices are in their hearts, his and only his counſell ſhall ſtand, <hi>Pro:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The next particular we ſhall conſider, in the laying of this moſt glorious foundation, is, that it was a more difficult work to lay it, in ſeveral reſpects, then any of the other; not more hard in reſpect of God, for to his power and wiſdome all things are alike eaſie, the greateſt as well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41908:49"/>
as the leaſt; but in regard, firſt of the nature of the work, ſecondly of the oppoſition that was, and is, and will be made againſt it while the world ſtandeth, all which time, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fight with the Dragon, and his Angels.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The laying the foundation of this work was hard, in regard of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excellencie which was therein to be ſhewed, and infinite wiſdome, power, mercy, juſtice, holyneſs, goodneſs, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and truth; and ſo tranſcendently, that nothing in the whole world in any of theſe reſpects is to be found like it, nothing to be compared with it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a received poſition, that excellent things are hard; here then being the greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, muſt needs be the greateſt difficulty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hard, by reaſon of the great and ſtrong oppoſition, that would ever be made againſt any appearance of any thing of this work in the world; when God laid the foundation of it, he perfectly knew what would be the hatred, violence, ſubtilty of the devill to oppoſe it at every turne in the world; he perfectly knew the intereſt the devill would have there, to be for a time, by uſurpation the God of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41908:49"/>
he knew what great and how many ſubjects he would have there, how loyal they would be to him their Liege Lord, reſolving to forſake all others to cleave to his ſervice, to be ſubject to his commands, to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the Scepter of his Kingdome; and he knew well long before, how many great and hypocritical nations in a great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, Satan would have, though ſometimes more and ſometimes leſs, under ſuch his Dominion, that with the whore in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> would ſay, they have done no evill, while their eyes, their hearts, their lives are full of adulteries in Gods ſight; yea, he ſees when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt love to his dear ſon Chriſt Jeſus, they mean to murther him in his living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſo [<hi>ſub nomine Chriſti militant contra Chriſtum</hi>] under the name of Chriſt they fight againſt Chriſt (<hi>manibus pedibuſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
               </hi>) as we ſay, with all their might; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, for all that while, heart and hand, tooth and nayle, they are for the devill. Aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant diſcovery might be made of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that God fully knew, and in every particular fully diſcovers every moment, in every place, in every perſon of every ranke, in every thing. Oh would all ſorts of ſuch perſons, but ſeriouſly weigh, how
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41908:50"/>
fooliſhly they go about to make Gods great deſign difficult, of which, notwithſtanding, he hath laid the foundation moſt ſure, as we ſhall indeavour to ſhew; But yet here is not all, for thirdly, when God laid this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he ſaw a greater difficulty then all theſe from the devil, or the world; he ſaw (in reſpect of them for whom that great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking immediately was) there was not only <hi>incapacitas,</hi> but <hi>repuguantia objecti,</hi> not only an uncapableneſs, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance by ſuch as ſhould receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: If a moſt noble and vertuous Prince have his royal and dearly beloved conſort, carried away by malitious and moſt hareful enemies, this would but incite him the more to lay out his intereſts for her reſcue, but if when all is done, he findes her affections ſo alienated, that ſhe joynes all her Intereſts with his enemies, not only to avoid, but alſo to reſiſt her Royal and moſt loving husband; this deadens the deſign, makes the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs much more hard; this, and much worſe, was the caſe when God laid the foundation of his moſt gracious work, he knew we would joyn with our hateful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and reſiſt our greateſt good, and this difficulty therein, he moſt graciouſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41908:50"/>
againſt; in his other works there was no ſuch incapacity, much leſs reſiſtance; when he ſpake the word, they were made, when he commanded, they were created, and ever ſince, what ever the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he hath done in heaven, and in earth, in the ſeas, and in all deep places, only man is the untunable ſtring in the harmony of the Creatures in this inferior Orbe, and ſo fooliſhly wicked, he will not only reſiſt his God, but his own good; this was indeed exceeding hard to provide againſt, and a difficulty invincible in regard of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but not too hard for the infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſs of a moſt gracious God to provide againſt, and overcome by Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the foundation of this work of God was harder to lay, then of any other of his great works in the world, ſo likewiſe it is more excellent then the reſt, in that it is moſt ſurely laid above all the reſt, what reſpected man in the Creation, though an excellent Creature then, yet was on ſo unſtable a foundation, that it was ſuddainly loſt. Now for ſuch queſtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man might not have ſtood longer in that Eſtate? or how long? or what ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41908:51"/>
of him when the world ſhould end? or the like, we ſhall not meddle with them, being ſecret things belonging to God, and not revealed, which only belong to us, and to our children; that in his greateſt perfection he did not ſtand, and therefore was not upon a ſure foundation, while his happineſs was in his own keeping, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plainly ſhew, and the woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his whole race doth ſadly declare, had not the infinite grace of the Almighty <hi>Jehovah,</hi> provided a firme baſis of Goſpel glory, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. 16. Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation; a Text often recorded and expounded of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, but very fully by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Ep.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. who is therefore called the Mediator of a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. and the ſurety of a better Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that God hath not left the ſecurity thereof in any hand but his own, his arme brought ſalvation, upholds, applies, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people, to whom he is gracious, becauſe he will be gracious, and ſhews com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, becauſe he will ſhew compaſſion, in giving to them the ſure mercies of <hi>David,

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> becauſe he hath put or ſet for me an everlaſting Covenant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things and ſure, for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. And this is Gods ſure mercies to him, and if it was poſſible to make it more ſure God adds his oath to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him that was to be the Mediator of it, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> which is ſpecially applyed to this Goſpel glory of the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. even through him who was <hi>after the power of an endleſs life, v.</hi> 16. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>We come now in the fourth place, a little to take a view of the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

ſtructure, frame and forme of this work; now though the frame and forme of the world, as it is Gods Creature made, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and ordered by him, hath a great glory in it, yet that glory, as the Apoſtle in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a like caſe ſpeaketh, is not glory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this, for as the nature and the matter of this did exceed the other, ſo the forme, as we ſhall indeavour to ſhew, will appear to exceed theirs much more, even as much as an eſſential forme exceedeth an outward ſhape or figure obvious to the eye; for as the Phyloſophers ſay of the Soul, it is, <hi>tota</hi> in <hi>toto &amp; tota</hi> in <hi>qualibet parte,</hi> ſo we may ſay of the form of this wonderful glorious work, which ſeems to be this [the glorious ſhining forth of Gods moſt free and infinite grace unto men and Angels here and hereafter] which, as our Saviours expreſſion is, to all ſingle-eyed beholders, is obvious to be diſcerned, yea, there is no part of the foundation or fabrick of the whole work, wherein it doth not wonderfully ſhine out to ſuch ſoules (in their better temper at leaſt) which if it do not unto any (at leaſt when they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) it is becauſe they are not, as in the Text, transformed into the ſame Image: if
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41908:52"/>
the glory ſhining in the work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when that was finiſhed, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then, wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeaventh Day Sabbath, and hallowed it, that his people might have a weekly opportunity to worſhip and celebrate his praiſe, for the innumerable benefits conferred on them by Creation; then how much more, may the glory ſhining much more brightly, when Chriſt Jeſus our Lord having finiſhed the whole work of redemption by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, gloriouſly triumphed over all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe powers of darkneſs, occaſion him the Lord of the Sabbath, to put it over to the firſt day, and is juſtly therefore by his holy ſpirit intitled to himſelf the Lords day, our Chriſtian Sabbath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. even when in the higheſt raptures he communicated ſo divinely to that beloved Diſciple, the great things to be accompliſhed in reference to the Church and her enemies, to the end of the world: now as the perfected glory of the Saints hereafter, ſhall ſwallow up the incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate glory here, or as the glory of the Lord our redeemer, ſeems to ecclypſe the luſtre of the glory of the Lord our Creator, as the ſhining light of the ſun doth the brightneſs of the Moon, when they appear both together

in our hemiſphere, even ſo is the glorious forme and beauty of this work tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently above the other.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The largeneſs of the time, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance allotted for this work, above all the other excellent illuſtrations of it. Firſt, <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio fit in inſtanti,</hi> ſo the Learned, Creation is done in an inſtant; the whole work was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and celebrated in a weeks ſpace at firſt, ſuſtentation is the continuance of that for a limited time; and Gubernation here, is but while this courſe of nature, or Creatures, or rather ſupportation in their rankes from God, is ſo variouſly diſpoſed of in ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner, after the good pleaſure of his will, but the time allotted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, effecting, applying, confirming, carrying on and perfecting this moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of Goſpel grace, is not only a long time, but all time, and not only time, but eternity too, yea, all eternity in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the eternal and coequal Trinity of perſons, in the unity of the divine nature: Now this illuſtration of the length of time, for rayſing a work, may more clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from a threefold evidence; Firſt, of nature, the baſer ſort of creatures ſoon come to their height of ſtature, as is obſervable in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41908:53"/>
varieties of ſorts of plants, and beaſts, and fowls. Secondly, in Reaſon, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the nature of a work, and the more accurately it is to be wrought, the longer time is required to provide for it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. Thirdly, in experience, both of Nature &amp; Art; by all which, the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance for the rayſing of this work, may be manifeſt above all the reſt, which is an other of its excellencies; unto which let us now adde the</p>
            <p>Sixt, Namely, in regard of the way and manner of the rayſing of this work, by the conſtant ſhining out of the wonderful glory of the Father, Son, and Holy ghoſt, all the time it is in rayſing. Oh the unſpeakeable ſplendor of the wiſdome and power, of the grace and goodneſs, of the mercy and truth, in reference to all the holy perſons in that undivided Trinity, made evident therein, from the beginning of the world, and ſhall be to the end thereof, in ſuch glorious mn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations, continually, breaking forth through all ſucceſſions of Ages, as can never be ſufficiently admired, nor much leſs ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with praiſes both from men and Angels, in all things that concern the way and manner of the revealing &amp; exhibiting, as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41908:54"/>
will be of the perfecting of that moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace, from and by thoſe ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons derived. Whether we reſpect the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, the ſureneſs, the efficacy, the happineſs in ſuch way and manner conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually held out, and communicated unto the world; Firſt, ſufficient to make up all the Creatures wants, to anſwer all their doubts. Secondly, Sure to remove all their fears, &amp; ſettle all deſirable ſecurity to them. Thirdly, Effectually to carry on againſt all obſtacles, and to accompliſh all and more then they could hope for or deſire. Fourthly, To adminiſter what ever good they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving, to make them perfectly bleſſed; let your thoughts be inlarged upon theſe particulars, I muſt leave them as the dry bones in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Propheſie, till the Spirit cauſeth fleſh to come upon them, to cover them; for I feare to be tedious, even in a ſubject ſo precious and pleaſant, to ſuch as have intereſt in it, but therefore not pleaſant unto others, becauſe they find not any to themſelves, yea, they know it not, and therefore they deſire it not, yea, they are not willing to know it, leaſt they muſt looſe thoſe Idols wherein they take more pleaſure: But thus much at preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

of Gods own undertaking, in the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner to all his own moſt bleſſed purpoſes, reſpecting both himſelf and his creatures, according to his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as we ſhall indeavour afterwards to ſhew, and is evident from all paſſages to this purpoſe in holy writ, unſpeakeably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is to be found in any other his great and glorious works, here being a way for the magnifying of the riches of his free grace, only revealed in his word, which is therefore magnifyed above all his name, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith remarkably, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138. in ſuch a concurrence of all Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies as is no where elſe to be found, ſince there and there only, we have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, In regard of the ſubordinate meanes of raiſing up this work, [not here to ſpeak of the chief, the holy Spirit as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father and the Son] for we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as the Lord the Spirit, the prime efficient cauſe of the efficaciouſneſs of all other meanes; but only of his inferior means, ſuch as Angels, men extraordinarily inſpired, ordinarily qualified, ordinances ſanctified,

Angells ſinned in an higher rank and ſtation, and with a more generall and high attempt againſt Gods Crowne and Dignitie, when man that was in a lower condition look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to be like God in knowing good and evill, not to be equall in dignitie to him; the Angels therefore are in Juſtice caſt down

How was then the Juſtice and mercy of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe God, in appearance, at a great conteſt, which ſhould prevaile for or againſt man? Juſtice would be ſatisfied upon him, mercy would be glorified in him; Juſtice looks upon his ſin againſt the infinite God, with all the aggravations of it; mercy looks upon the forlorne helpleſſe ſtate of man, with all ſuch mittigations and extenuations of his fall, as ſhe could diſcover; here were indeed the fire and the wood, wrath and the fit object of it, <hi>but where is the burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> once ſaid unto his father, when his father expecting he ſhould be the Lambe, anſwered him more truly then he knew or thought of, <hi>God ſhall provide himſelfe a Lamb;</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41908:58"/>
inſtead of his ſucceſsfull labour without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, he ſhall be vexed with much loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and wearineſſe therewith, [<hi>Aethiopem lavabit, magno conatu magnas nugas aget,</hi>] he ſhall often endeavour to no purpoſe, and greatly endeavour to no purpoſe, and greatly endeavour to ſmall purpoſe; but yet worſe than this, in his priſon he ſhall have a Jaylour too, but the worſt of creatures by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and his own worſt enemy, his hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and firſt murtherer (at leaſt in his hopes and purpoſes,) had not God then in ſuch a caſe ſpeedily, graciouſly, and unexpectedly ſtept in for his reſcue or reprieve: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch deliverance particularly can come home, by reaſon this curſed Jaylour, having man in ſome ſort in his cuſtody, endeavours to make him his perpetual vaſſal, and when in this he finds he doth prevaile ſometime, ſuch ſhall have the priviledge of his priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, but only for this moſt wretched end, to make them the more ſworne ſlaves to himſelfe, to others he will not vouchſafe the like libertie of their priſon, but holds them faſt in hard bondage, and becauſe he would the more harden them for hell-torments hereafter, he begins to plague them with an hell upon earth, but not as men ſometimes put in <hi>Bedlam</hi> by their friends to regaine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41908:59"/>
their wits, but to make them ſpiritually the more mad, and eternally the more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; any way to engage them the moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally to his vaſſallage, and eternally to his torments, and the rather, becauſe that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſpitefully, he yet ſurely knowes, there is a yeare of <hi>Jubile</hi> proclaimed from the moſt Soveraigne and Almightie King, and that there is a Deliverer Come, by whoſe appointment Heralds at Armes, or rather Embaſſadours of peace, are ſent abroad to publiſh the ſame with the conditions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, upon abundant teſtimony under his hand and ſeales with ſufficient authoritie and moſt certain evidence for mans ſecuritie therein; but yet I ſay upon his own tearmes alone. But how doth the Devil their Jaylour now play his pranks, to diſappoint the purpoſe of ſuch publiſhed grace, and to keep his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners either from hearing (if poſſible) the ſound of this good newes, by ſtopping it from their eares, or if he cannot doe that, to ſtop their eares againſt it by many diverſions of hopes, or eaſe, or pleaſure, or profit, or elſe by prejudice, or danger, or reproach, or feare, or perſecution, or any thing, or all (if it may be) to hinder the ſame, that they may not come neare to hearken to thoſe commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41908:59"/>
Heralds at Armes, or Embaſſadours of peace; but if they muſt needs be within the hearing of them, he will diſparage their termes, as too hard, impoſſible, not ſure, not warrantable, or too damnifying, or the like; he will tell them falſe tales of golden apples, and ſweet and pleaſant grapes, which are growing for them in his Garden, when they are indeed but apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and grapes of <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> aſhie apples, and bitter grapes; he will tell them much of great treaſures and pleaſures with him to be had, when they are, but as men ſay of Witches feaſts in the caves of the earth, only phantaſticall, but nothing reall; he will tell them of golden mountaines they ſhall have by his ſervice, when there is nothing but fire and flames of brimſtone in the bowells thereof, belching forth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before-hand their noyſome ſtench, with flames and ſmoake and aſhes of Gods wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpleaſure againſt them; Yet all the Devills priſoners will hearken more to his lyes, than unto Gods Embaſſadours, or his truth, all the while they are in his bondage, and knowing nothing better than what they at preſent conceive they find, they will not be perſwaded that there is any thing better than what they think they know; Neither
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41908:60"/>
will they believe that they ſhall finde any thing worſe hereafter, than what they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feele; and ſo what with his charmes and baits on the one hand, and what with his gyves, manacles, and chaines on the other hand, their eares are either ſtopped like the deafe Adders that refuſe to heare, or elſe bored through at his doore, like voluntary ſlaves readily agreeing with him for their own perpetuall bondage. But here the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working God againe appeares, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſealed ſome to the day of Redemption, and having given thoſe unto the Redeemer, whom likewiſe the Redeemer hath particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and fully ranſomed, even thoſe he will reſcue out of that bondage, yea out of that death of ſin and Satan; unto them are his Embaſſadours ſpecially ſent, but they likewiſe will not heare, and therefore while he ſends many times and often for a long continuance, (it may be) and importunately by them in his own name, beſeecheth them to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him for their own good, though (happily) they may be rouſed a little ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yet they are not raiſed from that ſleep, and death, till God the Father, and God the Redeemer, by the Allmightie power of the <hi>Lord the Spirit,</hi> ſpeaks home to their ſouls,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41908:60"/>
what outwardly, and only outwardly, they had heard before with their eares, many times (perhaps) only, but not regarded to retaine, till he himſelfe comes in, and ſets on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his grace-revealing truth upon their hearts, with a ſecret quickening ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life; Upon diſcovery or feare whereof in any of Satans priſoners, their former Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour attempts with ſpeed to hinder (if he can) if not to conſent, yet to divert or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And what miſchiefe he is kept any way from doing againſt them, he will ſend Heards of his graceleſſe Wolves, and of his filthy Goats and Swine, to doe for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41908:61"/>
him, and againſt Chriſts ſheep, to deſtroy or defile them, or rend them for their pearles, or like his wild Boares out of the Woods to deſtroy them: But whilſt they are paſſing a painfull pilgrimage, and often fall into a Wildered condition in this world, the great Shepheard of his ſheep, that will looſe none of them that are of his fould, he readily ſeeks them out, not ſo much for the place where, (for his eye is alwayes toward them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) as for the condition wherein, and the fit ſeaſon of grace to be uſed for their advantage, they ſhall not then want needfull comfort, or needfull ſupport, or neceſſary ſupply, oft they have all theſe largely allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and if they have not at preſent, they have a ſtore-houſe, a full treaſure of all good to goe unto at need, and in their worſt times they have two good friends at hand that will not fail them then, to wit, a good Conſcience, and the holy Ghoſt, who hath taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoules; and theſe are ſtrong hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers againſt the fierce and fiery aſſaults of Men and Devils, yea, they have hereby more help with them, and for them, than they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times themſelves diſcerne; Their God is a God at hand, and not a farre off, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſtands by them, being the grand Captain

of all conditions, upon all occaſions, is but the leaſt part [as we ſay of all knowledge] of that which in this kind might be known: but as the Evangeliſt <hi>John, chap.</hi> the laſt, <hi>v.</hi> the laſt, ſpeaks in thoſe high expreſſions of Chriſts works upon earth: ſo may we ſay of theſe, the weake underſtandings, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of all men upon earth, are not able to reach or remember them; but when thoſe manifold foldings of Divine wiſdome, held out in ſo many great Folioes of undecyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Characters, in ſuch his diſpenſations of his grace and goodneſs, ſhall be, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glorified Saints and Angels fully explained, and opened, and the injoyments of everlaſting fulneſs of glory in clear viſion, ſhall not only reveale the originall ſpring of all ſuch currents of flowing mercy to all ſorts of men, but ſhall hold out in clear manifeſtations, how in all theſe, or what ever the like, or other, or greater actings, which have been towards themſelves, in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the miſtery of that glorious grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and exhibited in their temporal and ſpiritual being in the world, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their eternal happineſs in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, was from God the Father, through God the Son, and by God the holy

            <p>And herein, according as they have been appointed and exerciſed by thoſe ſoveraign diſpenſations in the work, in the greater ſervice, they ſhall be glorified accordingly with the greater meaſure of happineſs in the world to come, and ſo much the more largely ſhall they diſcern the excellency of the glorious, and gracious workings of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for the true Church, through all generations, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be inlarged with rejoycing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the everlaſting praiſe of his, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly glorious grace diſplayed thereby.</p>

Becauſe when they knew God</hi> (by his outward works) <hi>they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful,</hi> therefore he gave them up; if ſuch works of God diſcover him not more unto thee, they will cauſe him the more to hide his face from thee; as is obſerved of ſome skilful experienced Phyſitians, they know and ſee ſo much of the ſecret opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, that by that means they become more Atheiſtical, forgetting and neglecting the God of Nature; they pore ſo much upon the excellencies of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

which they think they know and make uſe of by their own skill &amp; induſtry, for their temporall advantage, that they therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and neglect the Creator, and the glory therefore due unto him; and doth not this Atheiſme grow upon men for the want of ſpelling the words and ſentences of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Books in the world, by the teaching of his Word, whileſt men would chuſe rather to be thought great Naturaliſts and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the world by others, when without that teaching they become meere naturalls, fooles, and Ideots, rather than ſoundly judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons in that which mainly ought to be knowne, obſerved, and acknowledged by them, to the glory of the all-working God.</p>

And there is no difference, but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe makes in theſe wayes of his grace, for <hi>who makes thee to differ from another,</hi> 1 Cor: 4. 7. Let them walk in the light and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſuch diſcoveries, which amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians is often received in varieties of meaſures, and ought to be improved to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of purpoſes; Let them long more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them than any other things deſireable; as the Spouſe in <hi>Cant: 1. 2.

            <p>And what then by glorified Saints will be done to their beſt ability, will be more amply accompliſhed by the glorious Angels who never ſinned, who are of far higher and greater excellency, higher in degree, and therefore more eminent inſtruments of Gods praiſe; they have larger capacities, and therefore fit to receive greater diſcoveries of his glory; they are faithful and ancient (though ſecret) Miniſters of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in all ſuch willing and active ſervice, as he hath at any time aſſigned them unto,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41908:71"/>
even from the beginning, through the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on and perfecting of his Goſpel glory; they are of long experience, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all times, have had exceeding excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcoveries thereof: upon all which conſiderations, they may then in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects be happily helpful to ſaved Saints, to afford them their better aſſiſtance, and their more eminent examples, in doing that which is all their happineſs, of which this is but the brief compriſal [<hi>All Glory to the God of Glory, and to the Lambe that was ſlain, ſitting upon the Throne, and to the moſt holy Lord the Spirit, for ever and ever.</hi>] But what we can but now dimly hint at, in this Goſpel glofirying grace, beleeving ſouls ſhal in their ſeaſon fully and perfectly find by moſt happy experience accompliſhed: we come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the laſt reſpective conſideration, and that is</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The bleſſed effects thereof above all other his works, which how great, how various, how many, how admirable, how ſtrong, how glorious, how invincible, how comfortable, how delightfull, how ſatisfying, even in this preſent pilgrimage, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is either ſure or ſatisfying, how truly and really good in it ſelfe, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41908:72"/>
is beſides it, or without it, how largely it extends its force, how infallibly it will ſhew forth its vertue, how prevalently it will carry on againſt all oppoſition, how moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will attaine its end, becauſe the power of God, the wiſdome of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God, is alwayes in the wheels of its motion, as in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, <hi>Chap:</hi> 1. 20. So that time would faile me, ſtrength would faile me, opportunitie would faile me, (and much more able Heralds of the renowne of this glorious grace) in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſure to diſplay the ſame. I ſhall only adviſe all ſorts of Chriſtians at preſent, by the due uſes (or the like) even now in ſome meaſure pointed out unto them, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde in themſelves, ſuch effects, which by ſuch due improvement, they may (through grace) in their times and ſeaſons, diſcover or obtaine; Concerning which the holy Prophet of old, and our Apoſtle here, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 9. tells us, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare, heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man,</hi> not only what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and will conferre in another life, but what he hath prepared and doth conferre in this life too, according to the good pleaſure of his own holy will, and likewiſe to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41908:72"/>
praiſe of his preſent ſo excellent Goſpel grace, manifeſt in all his Saints, in all ſuch varieties of the happy and glorious effects thereof. And ſo without any further inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at preſent, in this ſo vaſt a field of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the manifold excellent effects of Goſpel glory, in regard of men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, good and bad, here and hereafter, (a ſubject well worth weighing by the beſt mens beſt abilities) for as the contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be a ſpring of comfort and happineſſe to the one ſort, ſo the abundant conviction and experience of the realitie of the ſame, will be the ſting of the miſery of all the other ſorts, it will ſo grinde and gnaw and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the damned ſpirits and perſons, ſo to finde what they have loſt for a ſhaddow, for nothing, yea, for that which is worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, even ſo unconceiveable good, that it is Queſtioned in the Schools (and not without cauſe,) whether [<hi>Paena damni</hi> or <hi>paena ſenſus</hi>] that is, whether the puniſhment of the Damned in regard of what they have loſt, or the puniſhment of ſence and feeling, in regard of what ſhall be inflicted on them in Hell, ſhall be (as I may ſay) the greater Hell unto them hereafter: But I ſay at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we ſhall paſſe from this head to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41908:73"/>
next, namely, The third demonſtration of this excellent truth, in which, and in the reſt, we purpoſe (if God will) to be more brief, and that is to manifeſt Goſpel Glory to be the great Glory of the Lord, which his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcerne in this world, in that regard it is the only and excellent, yet generall meanes for them all, to bring them to the reall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of true ſpirituall glory here, and the fruition of eternall glory hereafter; and to make indeed grace and glory to be both gracefull and glorious to them.</p>
            <p>Something we have ſpoken of this by way of compariſon of its tranſcendent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with that which was leſſe: But here we are to take notice, that as it is the efficacious way, and appointed by God unto that high and happy end; ſo it is the only meanes, no other to be expected, none elſe to be uſed directly in reference unto that end; for as there is no name given under heaven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can be ſaved, but by the name of Chriſt; ſo no other meanes to convey that ſalvation to us, but by this Goſpel of grace; If any would be changed from evill to good, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace muſt doe it; if any would be freed from the evill One, and owned by him that is only good, Goſpel grace muſt doe it: if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41908:73"/>
any would be freed from the miſchiefe of ſin, and obtaine the bleſſing of Divine favour, Goſpel grace muſt doe it; If any man would aſcend up to heaven, or deſcend down to hell, or take the wings of the morning, and fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the utmoſt parts of the earth, as <hi>Pſal:</hi> 139. 8. Either to eſcape Gods wrath, or obtaine his favour any other way, it were but all in vaine; If any would try all the Mountebank Chyrurgery that Satan hath uſed in all the Ages of the world, all his falſe Religions, all the multitudes of his Hell-deviſed wayes of falſe worſhip, all his ſtrong deluſions, all his heartleſſe, (except of ſeduced deceived hearts) fruitleſſe, bootleſſe ceremonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, beggarly rudiments, bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, not warranted by the word of God, to cure the feſtered wounds of their ſin-pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted defiled conſciences, and that moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly all their dayes, they would but miſerably all that time, looſe their own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, defeat their own hopes, forſake their own mercy, obſtruct their own happineſſe, remedileſly plunge themſelves into eternall miſery. So that by this, men muſt be both ſanctified and ſaved, if at all, and without this, and beſides this, there is no other means to attaine the ſame. All Gods brood of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41908:74"/>
have paſſed along in this roade, till they came to appeare before God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Zion;</hi> and none can otherwiſe poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attaine to that only deſireable iſſue of their pilgrimage here upon earth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here need to ſpeak any thing of the freeneſſe of this now moſt neceſſary means in regard of men, [for there is neither neceſſitie of nature, or of any coaction from creatures in reſpect of God] but only the good pleaſure of his moſt holy Will, is the prime originall of all. I need not touch upon the proportionableneſſe of the meanes, this only ſalve or Balſome ſo prepared by him, to cure the ſouls wounds, being every way fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſuited for its ſoares. I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon the eaſineſſe, the amiableneſſe, the naturallneſſe, the familiarneſſe of the way of diſpencing and beſtowing this Goſpel grace. I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſneſſe of this moſt gracious diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the holy Ghoſt; all which tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this particular, that it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and only meanes to bring Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reall participation both of grace and glory here and here-after; becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former head we have touched upon divers things bordering upon theſe, and we
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41908:74"/>
likewiſe ſtudy brevitie, though here may be large and excellent matter for Chriſtian meditation; Only in a word, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to touch upon the other branch, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, [that without this diſcovery of Goſpel glory unto the ſoule, grace would neither be rightly gracefull, nor true glory truly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eyes of men;] even as ſuch men who are guided by ſenſe, mainely live more like beaſts than men, like the mil-horſe in his tract, follow the deſires of their own eyes, and are led on by every vaine deludeing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and neither regard to know, or purſue better things, but wholly in a manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to proſtitute their reaſonable ſouls, to ſenſitive bruitiſh pleaſures, as if they were capable of no greater good; and as thoſe men, that upon a better improvement of the like (it may be) a leſſe, and yet againe ſometimes a greater abilitie, are raiſed up to an higher attainment; as many of the ancient Philoſophers and Heathens Sages, who by ſtudy, contemplation, and induſtry in the uſe of pertinent means, attained to the diſcovery of an excellencie of morality, in their kind, which they called (vertue) wherein they did ſometime ſeem to behold ſuch lovelyneſs, that it made them not only
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41908:75"/>
to commend it to others, but deemed that men could not know the beauty and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and not be in love with it: The like, and much more we may ſay of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Goſpel grace, to ſuch as obtain any competent diſcovery thereof; O how are they inamoured with it! How do their hearts run after it! How highly do they prize it! How earneſtly do they purſue it! How unwilling are they to part with it! yea, what high reſolution do they take up, not to part with it, upon any termes; they will buy the truth, but not ſell it, as <hi>Pr.</hi> 23. 23. yea, and rather to part with all beſides, then that; but as on the other hand Moralliſts, for all their diſcoveries and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, do not, cannot prevail with ſenſual brutiſh perſons, to forſake their ſwiniſh luſts, to love or like, much leſs to purſue their vertues, and yet thoſe Sages knew the worth thereof, to be incomparably above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; even ſo it is with that much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſcovery of Goſpel glory, though a truly regenerate and ſanctified ſoul ſees ſuch beauty, ſuch lovelineſs, ſuch joy and ſollace, yea, true happineſs in thoſe Goſpel gracious diſcoveries, that they not only like it, and commend it, but as ſome Ancients,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41908:75"/>
concerning ſome amorous perſons, were wont to phraſe it, [<hi>perdite amant alias</hi>] they love others to the looſeing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo it may be ſaid of their loving of Goſpel grace, but in a good and neceſſary ſence, as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5. If any love Father or Mother, Wife or Children, more then me, he is not worthy of me [<hi>perdite amant gloriam Evangelicam,</hi>] they deſtructively love Goſpel glory, that they will rather looſe friends and credit, eaſe and poſſeſſions, liberty, life and all, then to ſuffer a divorce between that and their own ſoules: But for all other men, or any other man to deſire it, to purſue it, upon a true Goſpel account, as beleeving or ſeeing it to be ſo excellent and glorious, or upon ſuch termes to purſue or retain it, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing or ſuffering for it; the heathen Sages might much more eaſily have prevailed with any ſuch beaſts in the ſhapes of men, then any ſanctified ſoul or Embaſſador of Chriſt can prevaile with any, to take right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, or much leſs to be ſo enamoured, of that moſt excellent object of ſoul ſollacing grace, untill they come to be transformed into the ſame image, by the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But this will yet further appear
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41908:76"/>
in the next demonſtration, namely; In that ſuch Goſpel grace in the ſouls of the Saints, differs not in nature from their heavenly glory, but only in degrees: A man that is in any good meaſure in heaven in his ſpiritual part, here upon earth, ſhall certainly inherite the kingdome of Heaven hereafter; and ſuch within: whom (as our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>Luk.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1.) the kingdome of heaven is really here ſeated by Goſpel grace, they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly obtain a Crown of glory, which will never fade to all eternity; and indeed heaven would not be heaven unto them then, when they ſhould come to poſſeſs it, if that kingdom of heaven had not taken poſſeſſion of their ſouls before, to fit them for it: a blind man may as ſoon be affected with the meer placeing of pleaſant ſights before him, or a deaf man delighted with the ſound of any muſick which he cannot heare, as men or women truly rejoyce in the glorified Saints and Angels happineſs hereafter, if they have not here their Celeſtial frame of ſpirit wrought upon their ſouls; yea, the very ſociety of glorified Saints, would be a kind of hell to wicked men remaining ſuch, if they had no other hell to ſuffer; for as it cannot be expected the wolfe ſhould lye
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41908:76"/>
down with the Lambe, untill Goſpel grace have wrought the change of nature here, as the ſpirit of God hath foretold, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11. 6, 7. 8. ſo until that nature be changed, yea, a contrary put into the ſoule of a man, the Saints perpetual ſongs of prayſe to God, and the Lambe, and the Lord the Spirit, would not only be unſutable and unpleaſant, but a ſenceleſs ſubject to ſuch a ſoule, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had followed Chriſt in the regeneration, nor ſeen, nor felt, nor rightly known before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the Divine power of Goſpel grace, the miſtery of the goſpel, then the matter of the Saints everlaſting rejoycing would be, ſuch an hidden ſealed miſtery, that ſuch unbeleeving and diſobedient ſouls would not underſtand it, ſaving only ſo far as to have convinced and ſelf-condemned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences thereby, little underſtanding what they may ſometime ſeem to pray or hope for here, concerning the kingdom of heaven, who in their diſpoſitions and depraved nature doe [<hi>toto caelo deferre</hi>] ſtand at the greateſt diſtance from it; but when that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is once changed, that Lions are at peace with the Lambes, and the hurtful creatures lye down with the harmeleſs, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11. 7. then grace ſhall appear glorious unto ſuch,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41908:77"/>
and as their meaſure thereof ſhall be greater, the more it will appear ſo; and the more they grow in ſuch grace, the more they will delight in it; and the greater meaſure they ſhall obtain of it, the more heavenly glory hereafter will be allotted to them: It is true indeed, our heaven upon earth will have a mixture of vanity and corruption, and weakneſs together with it, <hi>till that which is perfect be come, then that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſhall be done away, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 10. I ſhall not ſtand here to inlarge upon the many conſiderations, which might to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be produced, in regard of the ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of glory till it be changed, and of its unſutableneſs unto ſuch glory; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſence of the want of any right, title, or intereſt in ſuch glorified Saints happineſs, with their own ſelf condemnation upon it; and the apprehenſion of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, eternal, infinite, divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them; as alſo the utter deteſtation that perfected Saints with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, will have of the hateful qualities of all devils and unſanctified ſouls of men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and even the very heavens natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy, and antipathy againſt them, to the utter expulſion of all ſuch, as poyſon,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41908:77"/>
out of them, ſince into them no unclean thing ſhall enter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 27. As Chriſtal glaſſes, rather then hold poyſon will break aſunder; even ſo the moſt pure, Chryſtaline heavens would rather break, then any devil or unſanotified perſons ſhould abide or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in them. Here indeed the Hony Bee and the toad or ſpider have both their places and imployments, and their injoyments too, together; the one to gather up its hony, the other to ſuck up their poyſon, the one to lurke in the naſtie corrupted or noyſome corners of the earth, the other in their ſweet and pleaſant hives and hony; the one inrich themſelves or feed upon their own deſtructive poyſon, the other inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, and feed upon their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, wholſome, healing, and ſtrengthning hony, which they have by diligent labour acquir'd: But when that woofull, poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, deſtructive nature of ſuch men, is in any good meaſure ſubdued, by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent power of Goſpel grace, O how ſweet will the ſpiritual kingdome of heaven be unto ſuch ſouls? how will the true Citizens of the ſpiritual Zion be owned and imbraced by them? How will their portion, their delicates be deſired above all others?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41908:78"/>
How will grace and glory be then longed for, ſought for by them above other things, yet theſe [<hi>paſſibus aequis</hi> (as we may ſay) in their due proportions, when they are in their right frame] not glory more then grace, but grace as the right promoter of glory; and indeed, that which is only truly glorious in its own nature, and which will meet with glory as the conſequent, the reſult, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it; by grace we have the firſt fruits, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 33. the earneſt penny, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. of glory and happineſs, in the injoyment of that, we injoy the ſanctifying ſpirits reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the witneſs of our peace, the ſealer of our redemption, the comforter of our ſouls, the teacher of all our ſound wiſdome and knowledge, the guider and orderer and preſerver of our whole ſpirits, ſoules, and bodies in the way of truth, peace, and glory, unto the appearing of Chriſt; and from thence their preſerver, in and unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 13. So that ſince grace is of ſuch neer conſanguinity, yea, of ſuch Identitie and oneneſs of the ſame eſſence and nature, with glory hereafter, and glory being not only the perfecting and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of grace, but the reſult, recompence and reward of it too, it is no wonder it is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41908:78"/>
here dignified with the moſt excellent title of Glory in the text, and that as proceeding from the moſt excellent author and fountain of it, the Lord, the glory of the Lord; the greateſt glory he hath manifeſted in this world, or greater, then to all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, ſave his true Church therein, at leaſt in that inward, ſpiritual, efficacious manner to their transformation into the ſame Image; and even greater then to his true Church under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though transformed likewiſe, yet in theſe goſpel times, it is more clear, more excellent, (as we formerly declared) and therefore ſuch as now with thoſe primative Saints ſpoken of in the Text, behold it, after the like manner, muſt needs (happily) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of the Lord, though but as in a glaſs, yet with open face. And thus much briefly of this particular likewiſe.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Demonſtration is from the conſideration, that it will be the everlaſting fountain, and never failing ſpring, continually affording matter of the perpetual Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs, bleſſings, and prayſes of the glorified Saints and Angels, unto the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, &amp; unto the Lambe, and unto the Lord the Spirit for ever and ever; In that perfect
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41908:79"/>
Eſtate of their happineſs, all the greatneſs of this glory, in the particulars we formerly ſet before you, beſides what ever elſe may moſt diſplay it, I ſay, the greatneſs of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, will then be moſt clearly unfolded, moſt largely diſcerned, moſt perfectly manifeſt unto them, to the infinite praiſe and glory of the Author, worker, and diſpenſer of all grace and glory; and their own happineſs and glory will be ſo much the more inlarged, as they know and feel, and canperform this moſt glorious work of praiſe; and as there are ſuch multitudes of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent companions and conſorts in this ſoule-ſatisfying, celeſtial, divine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy harmony; the profound depth, the miſterious ſecrecy, the otherwiſe, then by an infinite God, inſuperable difficulties, the moſt certain ſureneſs, and moſt ſettled ſecurity, of the laying of that foundation, how will it be known and admired, to the honour of him, that from eternity had ſo laid it? How will the glorious nature, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme thereof be in like manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played &amp; improved by them? How will all that they ſhall obſerve or diſcern of the time, durance and manner of rayſing ſuch a glorious ſtructure, be celebrated by them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41908:79"/>
with their due praiſe? How will then the infinite wiſdome, mercy, grace, compaſſion and riches of goodneſs, with the power, truth, holyneſs, juſtice, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of God, ſo gloriouſly ſhining out in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 6. and by the holy ſpirit diſcovered before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints, be continually in an happy meaſure obvious to the viſion? How will the knowledge of ſuch poor, yet ſuitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental means, that had ſuch treaſure in earthen veſſels, to convey ſuch glorious grace unto ſuch mean and unſutable objects, as men in their loſt Eſtate, ſo wonderfully, powerfully, and graciouſly, throughout all generations in the world, ſpring out unto them, with matter of continued, renewed melodie, in that moſt bleſſed, and glorious, heavenly harmony? How will the uſes then obſerved and improved by them to the uttermoſt, be compleated? How will the bleſſed operations and effects of this glory, then be fully known, noted, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, celebrated by them, with all due honor to the worker of them to all eternity? Here Gods Saints, according to their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in ſuch contemplations; may adore, and admire, in ſome poor meaſure, and by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41908:80"/>
the eye of faith, diſcerne ſuch things as God hath, both ſo wrought, revealed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, in and by the Goſpel of his Son. But the moſt happy inlargements, beatifical viſion, and perfect fruition of theſe things, both for their own moſt ſecure and ſatisfying happineſs, and the infinite and eternal praiſe of the Almighty One, will be then the everlaſting imployment of all ſuch glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints and Angels to all eternity; then will the unſpeakable excellencies of this glorious grace fully appear unto ſuch: O that men would therefore labour above all things, to get their part in it here, that they may have their portion in that happy ſociety hereafter, everlaſtingly, by theſe means to praiſe God with them, and in ſo doing to be perfectly bleſſed with them: And thus we have done with the proofe and illuſtration of this glorious truth: Proceed we now to add ſome further improvements, then what we have formerly touched upon, and ſo to draw on to a concluſion of the point.</p>

            <p>Secondly, To cure thy deafneſs, let him put his fingers into thine eares, and ſay, (<hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 33, 34.) <hi>Ephphatha,</hi> be ye opened; but it may be thou art dumb too, and canſt not ſpeak unto him, get him to touch the tyed ſtrings of thy tongue likewiſe, that they may be looſed; but being blind, deaf, and dumb too, thou wilt ſay, how ſhall I find him? how ſhall I come at him? how ſhall I make any application to him for his help? Anſ. Call for his embaſſadours, or come to his ſtewards, his meſſengers, make thy caſe known to them, take their direction or advice, and uſe their help, and walk on in all the wayes of Chriſt with them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will bring thee to the place where Chriſt keeps his Mart, for the cure of all thy ſpiritual diſeaſes and infirmities; they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41908:81"/>
are thy brethren, they have love towards thy ſoul; they are compaſſionate, they have a fellow-feeling of thy condition; they are men that have like paſſions as other mens, and therefore know how to ſhew compaſſion towards their brethren; they have had experience many times, both of the ſence of thy condition, and of their own cure; they have ſometimes frequented Chriſts Marts long, and perhaps have much helped off with his commodities unto others; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are willing, and ready many times, to conduct thee; and it is their office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee in the way, and to intreate for thee, yea, and to plead for thee too, (if need be) that Chriſt ſhould either take thee in hand, or goe on and perfect his cure, begun upon thy ſoule; and to beſeech the <hi>Lord the Spirit</hi> to make a right, home, and effectuall application of all Chriſts Phyſick to compleat the cure; And remember that by the way, which even the better part of men in the world, have much forgotten of late yeares, [That they are an Ordinance of Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by himſelfe to be uſed, by all his people to the end of the world] and they are many times good friends in the Court of heaven, and may much prevaile for thee, if
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41908:82"/>
thou wilt duly uſe them; they have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from Chriſt, and therefore they may be bold and couragious in this worke; beſides the experience, they get and feele more and more of his goodneſſe; Yea, let me tell thee, thou haſt no other meanes, whereby thou mayſt expect to be helped in the buſineſſe of thy ſoules ſound cure, if thou wilt neglect them, and reject them; <hi>For how canſt thou heare without a preacher,</hi> Rom: 10. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object:</hi> But times and places may not happily afford ſuch, for many may not be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with gifts and graces, as ſuch, if ſome have gifts, they may be depraved in their lives, yea ordinances may be diſgraced with mixtures of heaven and earth together, of Gods and mans conſtitutions in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> The caſe will then indeed be hard; for as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in the caſe of his own converſion, ſaid unto <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. 31. <hi>How can I underſtand, except ſome man guide me;</hi> yet God can in ſuch a caſe (as he did to him) ſend ſuch a Meſſenger, <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> and indeed his grace never brings to the birth, but he will give ſtrength to bring forth; by what ever way or meanes the ſeed thereof hath been ſowne, it will ſurely ſpring up; But for Meſſengers altogether unqualified,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41908:82"/>
either with gifts, or graces, or both, where any ſuch offer themſelves, they are not Gods: Men will not imploy a Phyſician, or Lawyer, ſo called, when they know they have no skill in their profeſſion; and ſurely men ought to be more choice for the health of their ſoules, than of their bodily health, or the right of their outward eſtate: But if they be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly qualified, authorized, and have ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gifts, <hi>They ſit</hi> (as our Saviour ſaid of the Scribes and Phariſees) <hi>in Moſes chaire, all therefore they ſay</hi> from Gods authoritie, <hi>heare;</hi> but if they be depraved in life, then againe <hi>doe not after their workes,</hi> (as he goes on) if they will <hi>binde burthens upon men not to be borne,</hi> Mat: 23. 2. as the teachers of the Law, <hi>Luk:</hi> 11. 46. There is a woe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them by Chriſt himſelf for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If there be mixtures of Ordinances, whilſt they be but of circumſtantiall things, when all the eſſentialls of Gods inſtitutions ſtand intire, neglect not duties upon ſmall diſcouragements; but if perſons, practiſes, Ordinances be ſo depraved, that Gods rules are ſo infringed, his faithfull ſervants ſo (juſtly) ſcandalized, that they have cauſe with thoſe in the time of the Miniſtration of <hi>Elies</hi> wicked ſonnes, to loath the offerings
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41908:83"/>
and ſervices of the Lord; the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is then very grievous, but ſuch Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers condition is, if not altogether ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate as <hi>Elies</hi> ſaid ſonnes, yet at leaſt very dangerous, if reformation be not haſtened; but in this kinde there will be great need many times to ſeek for particular, ſpeciall adviſe and counſell, both from God and his faithfull Embaſſadours, when he affords ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for it, wherein who ſo humbly and faithfully ſeek unto him, are not like to be diſappointed; <hi>For he that will doe the will of God, ſhall know the doctrine, whether it be of him, or whether men ſpeak of themſelves,</hi> Jo: 7. 17. But when in <hi>Iſrael</hi> the contemptible of the people were made Prieſts, and the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calves, upon politique conſiderations, were ſet up in <hi>Dan</hi> &amp; <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſo to buſie <hi>Iſrael</hi> with home-ſpunne worſhip, that they might not goe into <hi>Judea</hi> or unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unto the true worſhip, and that they approved and practiſed it, did foreſhew, and juſtly cauſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be led into captivitie by the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ever diſcouragements thou mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with from men, never give over thy humble and faithfull addreſſes to Chriſt, to diſcover his Goſpel glory unto thee; and if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41908:83"/>
men hinder or faile, thou wilt finde he will the more help, he can ſend an extraordinary Meſſenger, as <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch; he can make a little meanes help much; in mixtures he can make the good profitable, and the mixture of men to vaniſh as nothing; he can ſpeak himſelfe unto thy ſoul, as to <hi>Saul</hi> in an evill courſe, and ſend thee to an <hi>Ananias</hi> to help thee, whom thou never kneweſt before; in ſeeking to behold this Glory, God will not reject thee, as he did <hi>Moſes,</hi> in ſeeking to ſee his eſſentiall glory, <hi>Exod:</hi> 33. 20, 23. but ſeeking it earneſtly and faithfully, as there is all reaſon thou ſhouldeſt, thou ſhalt be ſure to finde it effectually.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is to diſcover the great condemnation of the world, that then when ſuch light, ſuch glorious Goſpel light is come into the world, men yet love darkneſſe more than light; yea they are ſuch Moules bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in the bowells of the earth, that they cannot either ſee or deſire, neither are they willing to ſee the bright beames of this light, ſhine they never ſo clearely, yea the brighter they ſhine, the leſſe they deſire them, the leſſe they diſcerne them; their owle-eyes cannot indure to behold the Sunne, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in darkneſſe, in the wayes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41908:84"/>
in the workes of darkneſſe, and for the moſt part chuſe rather to fall (by death) into utter darkneſſe, than to come to this light of life; ſo that ſuch as put this light from themſelves, or ſuch as hinder, and cloud it, or hide it from others, they muſt needs fall into a ſad condemnation; was there not only invincible ignorance, but obſtinacy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent upon the ſouls of men? did they not willingly upon their own hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences [<hi>Callum inducere</hi>] draw ſuch a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh hardneſſe, even to ſtand againſt the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which God many wayes makes againſt the ſtrong holds of Satan therein? ſo that they are not only Goſpel-proofe, but Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe too, ſo that neither the <hi>Boanerges</hi> or <hi>Barnabae,</hi> the ſons of thunder, or the ſons of conſolation that are ſent unto them, can either pierce them, or melt them, bow them or break them, but they will doe as they have done; if they have made cakes for the Queene of heaven, they will doe ſo ſtill; if they have ſerved God out of cuſtome more than conſcience, they will doe ſo ſtill; if they have added drunkenneſſe to thirſt, they will doe ſo ſtill; if they ſacrificed upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, they will doe ſo ſtill; if they have hated ſuch as beare the image of God upon
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41908:84"/>
them, they will doe ſo ſtill; yea though the greateſt and forcibleſt of Gods Ordinances play upon the Forts of their Hell-hardened Conſciences, they remaine impenetrable. What cleare light hath ſhined long in this Nation above all her neighbours? how hath God poured his Spirit remarkably, upon many perſons eminent amongſt us for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine endowments, being greatly inlarged with the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, and as willing as able to improve their talents, to their Maſters advantage, and the ſalvation of the ſoules of all ſorts of people! But if they come neere the ſoares of their ſoules, how doe men kick and ſpurne againſt them? then they are their enemies, becauſe they tell them the truth; if they would take away the vaile of ignorance from before their eyes, they will anſwer with the Phariſees, thoſe blind leaders of the blind, that they ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and therefore as our Saviour told them, ſo ſuch likewiſe might be told, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſin remaineth;</hi> if they would make them ſencible of their loſt eſtate, they have good hearts and meanings, and make many prayers, and it may be, if they were tryed through the whole Law of God, as Chriſt tryed the young man in the Goſpel, they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41908:85"/>
would be ready to plead for themſelves not guiltie, <hi>all theſe have we kept from our youth,</hi> when their plea is as falſe, as miſtaken by them; If Goſpel grace be never ſo much diſcovered to them, if the termes thereof be never ſo often and urgently preſſed upon them, they heare them not, they receive them not, they obſerve them not; if Satan or men will offer any thing elſe, vaine or fooliſh, ſenceleſſe, or frivolous, a little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from men, a little ingagement in the world will prevaile for their ſeducement, when Divine truth hath been little regarded for a long time, in reference to their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as our Saviour told the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they would not regard his heavenly counſel, <hi>If any ſhall come to them in his owne name, him they would heare,</hi> Joh: 5. 43. And hath not Satan varieties of deſignes and agents, to Eclypſe, or cloud, or hide, or even to guiſh (if poſſible) Goſpel-glory, now for many yeares brightly ſhining amongſt us? holding out varieties of ſtrong and ſtrange deluſions, ſometimes really groſſe and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to ordinary capacities, ſometimes more refined, and ſeemingly more ſpirituall, and appearing more neere to perfection, and yet ſtill wandering from the way of truth, yea
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41908:85"/>
ſometime to ſet up iniquirie by Law, and to obſtruct the moſt efficacious wayes and meanes to promote the advancement of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel glory? Have there not been ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of theſe things in our former and later Popiſh perſecutions? And let all reall and ſound Chriſtians earneſtly pray, there may not be any the like againe amongſt us; for ſhall we Queſtion it, That whilſt with <hi>Capernaum</hi> we are lifted up unto heaven in Chriſts ſpeciall approaches and intercourſes amongſt us, ſo much neglected, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too, by the generalities almoſt of men and women, that we ſhall not be equally with her caſt downe into Hell? Let not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deceive themſelves, God is not mocked, <hi>but as each man ſowes, ſo let him look to reape at his hands,</hi> Mat: 6. 7. If men weave the Spiders webs, and hatch the Cockatrice eggs, may they not juſtly expect that their webs ſhould faile to become garments, and that their eggs break forth into Vipers, to ſting or deſtroy themſelves or others? <hi>Iſa:</hi> 59. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To admoniſh all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as they deſire to have much glory in heaven, to labour much to behold the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel glory of the Lord in his Church upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41908:86"/>
earth, and ſo to behold it, as to be ſtill more and more transformed into the ſame image, yea in being ſo exerciſed, heaven will more come down unto them, and enter into their ſoules, there will be ſuch a glory as will make their ſouls truly delightfull, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, happie, ſuch as they would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or part with for the whole world; let them be much taken up with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and admiration of ſuch Goſpel grace and glory, and let their hearts and mouthes be filled with the high praiſes of God for it, in all reſpects of the ſhining glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, oh to what an height of divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will it raiſe their ſpirits! what large poſſeſſion will it give the Lord the Spirit of their ſoules? what earneſt longings will it cauſe after more of the ſame grace? what rejoycings and triumphings will it cauſe in the Lord of glory? what reſiſtance will it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford againſt worldly diſcouragements, intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements, ingagements, and all obſtructions and oppoſitions whatſoever againſt it? how will it ſweeten troubles, ſeaſon every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and adminiſter unto them the oyle of joy, even with the garments of heavineſſe? oh who would not drinke well of the wine of ſuch ſweet conſolation, to make them in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41908:86"/>
good meaſure, to forget their ſorrow, when (by faith) in the depth of ſorrow they ſhall ſo ſee Chriſt a Saviour for them, ſitting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and triumphantly at the right hand of God, as <hi>Stephen</hi> did wonderfully, while he was in ſtoning to death, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let this incite and ſtirre up all ſuch as have any true ſpirituall diſcoveries of Goſpel glory made unto their ſoules, hence to learne ſpiritually to exult and triumph in the name of the Lord, and in the power of his might, and in the evidence of his divine grace; for as our Saviour ſaid unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in another caſe, the like may be ſaid unto ſuch, <hi>Fleſh and blood bath not revealed this unto their ſoules,</hi> but the <hi>Lord the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> who is from heaven. Doe not the Starres ſtanding in the cleare aſpect of the Sunne, ſend forth their cleare and bright ſhining rayes in the view of the world? Doth not the earth when it receives its ſeaſonable and ſweet ſhowers and influences from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, ſend forth her tender ſprouts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits; for the uſe of creatures inhabiting upon it? Doe not the Valleys ſtanding thick vvith Corne, laugh and ſing, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 65. 13. And doe not all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures under the materiall heavens,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41908:87"/>
when God opens his hand, and fills them with his goodneſſe, ſing and rejoyce? and all of them materially praiſe the Lord, as ſhewing forth unto man ſuch ample matter of his praiſe and glory in all ſuch reſpects, continually due unto his divine Majeſtie from Men and Angells? which either doe, or ought to learne, that great leſſon from them? But then above all, when that inward, ſecret, divine grace, and ſpirituall glory, hidden from the eyes of all creatures, which none elſe attaine to know but thoſe to whom ſuch inward ſpirituall diſcovery is made, and none know their own, but they that have it; from whence there is gladneſſe put into the hearts of ſuch, as have this [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative <hi>to become the children of God,</hi> Joh: 1. 12. <hi>To be borne from above,</hi> Joh: 3. 3. yea <hi>to be borne of God,</hi> ver: 8. Being effectually <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image,</hi> as in the Text, by the <hi>Lord the Spirit;</hi> not only above that <hi>when mens corne and wine and oyle inoreaſeth,</hi> as <hi>Pſal:</hi> 4. 7. But as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>with joy unſpeak able and full of glory;</hi> and indeed when the glory of God hath once filled their ſouls, it is no wonder if they triumph in the God of all glory. O how ſhould this true ſight of the ſpirituall heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> upon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41908:87"/>
the top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> at ſome diſtance, make them with <hi>Moſes</hi> to be willing to leave a Wilderneſſe-worldly condition, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe unto that God, whoſe glittering beames of glory, have not only ſhined upon their countenance, as viſibly once on <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but into their ſoules, ſo ſeaſoning, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, ſweetning, ſupporting, comforting them, anſwerably to all that his moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, divine, all-guiding and ordering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhall diſpence unto them; <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life nor death, Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be able to ſeperate them from his love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus their Lord,</hi> Rom: 8. 38, 39. or it from them; Yea, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this advantage, God, Chriſt, ſpirituall and eternall joy, is really and truly here, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually and perfectly hereafter ſhall moſt infallibly be conveyed into, and for ever be continued unto their ſouls, and their whole man to all eternitie: O then know thy worth, (O ſanctified ſoule) that thou mayſt here in ſome meaſure ſuitably praiſe thy God, which, as ſuch, thou canſt not but deſire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe now, and ſhalt moſt certainly and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41908:88"/>
moſt happily performe hereafter, inceſſantly, unweariedly, and moſt delightfully; Let thy name whereby thou mayeſt remarkably be knowne in the world, be [<hi>Barachiah</hi>] bleſſe or praiſe the Lord, let his praiſe be ever in thy mouth, ever in thy heart, ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after, and aimed at in thy life; ſo will thy name be truly glorious, ſo will thy end be truly bleſſed, but thy portion perfect beatitude, everlaſting felicitie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, Let none content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an outward profeſſion of Chriſts Religion, unleſſe with the regenerate and truly ſanctified ſouls, they in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure likewiſe ſo behold the glory of the Lord, as to be therewithall changed into the ſame image, without which men may long enough beare the name of Chriſt, and yet never be owned by Chriſt, they may eate and drinke often in his preſence, and have him preached often in their ſtreets, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heare him ſay unto them, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, I never knew you,</hi> I never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of you, nor your ſeeming ſervice; yea, ſome alſo may preach Chriſt unto others, and that in many reſpects well too, and yet they themſelves be meer caſt-awayes, if they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41908:88"/>
do not aright behold this glory of the Lord. Were ſuch truths well conſidered, owned, believed, applyed, Chriſtians would be leſſe in ſeeming, more in ſubſtance, leſſe in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie, more in realitie, leſſe in ſhews, and more in truth, Satan could delude leſſe, grace would prevaile more, the Devil ſhould have fewer ſlaves, Chriſt would have more ſervants, ſin would have fewer Subjects, grace would have more favourites, hell would have fewer everlaſtingly condemned priſoners, heaven would have more eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enfranchized Citizens, to poſſeſſe or inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite them.</p>
            <p>Now for the better promoting of this great worke, let me offer unto thee theſe enſuing Conſiderations, amongſt many others which might be added.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider that the obtaining of this Burgesſhip, or being ſo free-borne unto it, is the firſt thing that ought humbly, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſtantly to be ſought for, by every Wiſe Virgin, and none but the fooliſh neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it; It is to be ſought for, firſt, in order, by the direction of our beſt Teacher, by the injunction of the beſt and infinitely greateſt King; <hi>Firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of heaven, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41908:89"/>
the righteouſneſſe thereof,</hi> Math: 6. 33.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in intention, with the converted Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <hi>What muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, in value and worth incomparable, <hi>What will it profit a man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, (and he knowes beſt that it profits nothing) <hi>for a man to gaine the whole world</hi> (were it poſſible, as it is not) <hi>and to looſe his own ſoule,</hi> Mark 8. 36.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in neceſſitie; <hi>For except</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>a man be borne againe, or borne from above, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God,</hi> Joh: 3. 3, 5.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In dignity or excellency, for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more to be borne of God, (as all his Saints are) then to be borne of bloods, or of the will of the fleſh, or of the will of man, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In truly comfortable fruition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the ſoule is like the needle in the marriners compaſſe, till it be this way poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at God for its reſt, will alwayes be in diſturbed motion. It was not only more truly honorable for <hi>David,</hi> that he was the truly faithful ſervant of the Lord, and the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, the man after
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41908:89"/>
Gods own heart, then that he was the King of Iſrael, the renowned Conqueror of Gods and his own enemies; but it was more true comfort, ſound ſatisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable and glorious joy, over and above all the reſt that he was, or did, or poſſeſſed in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider that this is only the really, true, and the only heaven upon earth, whereas all others (ſuppoſed heavens) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, are but Phantaſtical conceits, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing deluſions, ſweet poyſons, putative pleaſures, but intoxicating, and killing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider what a great advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is in the world, yea, above the world, and that in reſpect, both of her frownes, and her favours.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Saith the Apoſtle, yea are come unto the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41908:90"/>
and to the blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaks better things then that of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12. 22. Hence all things were eſteemed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parriſon, but droſs and dung, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but very loathſome garbidge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider what an unparralleld match thy ſoul utterly looſeth the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obtaining; if it be not thus in this life united unto Chriſt, in this Goſpel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the glory of the Lord unto her, for ſhe muſt either be married to Chriſt in that way here, or elſe the Devill will carry her as his captive ſlave to his moſt wicked luſt, and loathſome vaſſallage, without any hope of future reſpite, ranſome or reſcue: but if once it be ſo married unto Chriſt, how will ſhe be dignified, not only received into a Royal Eſtate, <hi>but be partaker of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. happy in her own good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, happy in her manifold intereſts in the Covenant, in all the promiſes of this life and a better, and thereby in Chriſt, in God, in Angels, in the Saints, in the good of both worlds, preſent and to come, happy in the preſent ſociety, union, and communion, with any or many of theſe (at the preſent) as we ſhewed even now, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41908:90"/>
but unſpeakeably more for the future; and happy (above all perſons that are void of this) in the preſent ſatisfaction, reſt, and ſupport they will find in, and from this, above all earthly vanities, which only by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſweetned comforts, as the love, care, and goodneſs of this ſpiritual bridegroome is delightfully tendred to his ſpouſe thereby: O what true Saints ſecurity in evill times, in all times, is there in this condition; what health, what wealth, what honor, what pleaſure, what joy, what ſolace, what true contentment if ſuch poore creatures would not unfaithfully, or fooliſhly be deficient to themſelves! O that Chriſtians would ſuffer their poor ſouls, yea, that they would by all good means afford them aſſiſtance, to make large comments upon every particular branch here offered to them, to the manifold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their own good? I being now reſtrained by many circumſtances from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeing in theſe, and divers other things, (as it were hinted only) in this ſubject, yet what is ſaid, may point out many pleaſant paths for thy ſoule, to expatiate and walk at large, in to her preſent greate refreſhment in this her earthly Pilgrimage; and I dare
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41908:91"/>
ſay, if ſhe be but once well acquainted with them, ſhe will never be willing to forſake them, and if upon error at any time, ſhe looſe her way, ſhe will never be at reſt, for quiet till ſhe find it again. I can here only now like the Statues uſed in croſs pathes, but point out to thee the right way: if thou be once in it, let it be thy care to keep it, it will be thy ſafety, it will be thy ſecurity, it will by thy ſatisfaction; thou wilt never repent thee of thy walking long or far there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yea, the further thou goeſt, the more thou gaineſt and advanceſt thy beſt deſignes thereby. O that men would conſider theſe things, and improve their time, their talents, their opportunities, their abilities to this excellent advantage, while time and ſeaſons of Grace continue, that God may have the glory of his Goſpel grace at their hands, their own ſouls and conſciences may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by receive their ſound peace and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation here, and eternally by the ſame means obtain their perfect happineſs, which he grants of his infinite compaſſion to poor wandring ſouls, through him who hath fully paid the price of their iniquities, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them ſuch a glorious grace, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41908:91"/>
ſent his holy ſpirit to make it effectual to them of his own good pleaſure; unto which undivided and moſt holy Trinity of perſons, in the Unity of the divine eſſence, be all the praiſe of all ſuch grace, by all his people, rendred and paid (as is moſt due) both now, henceforth, and for evermore,</p>

is recorded three ſeverall times, and after the laſt time, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue amongſt the <hi>Jewes:</hi> If I ſhall prove unto thee, that theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times are rightly numbred according to the yeare of our Lord, that is, that the firſt time was the 38 yeare, the ſecond time the 46 yeare, the third time the 48 yeare, and then in the meane while between the 35 yeare and the 38, likewiſe the 38 yeare and the 46. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 46 yeare and the 48. that <hi>Peter</hi> was not in <hi>Rome;</hi> laſt of all, that it was true of his promiſe, and after the 48 yeare came not at <hi>Rome,</hi> then I truſt thou wilt confeſſe with me that <hi>Peter</hi> was never 25 yeares Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but all Popery as it is in it ſelfe nothing but lyes, ſo it is grounded wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon lyes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is agreed upon by all, and the thing is plaine in it ſelf, <hi>Paul</hi> was converted in the yeare
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41908:95"/>
of our Lord, 35. then <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">Gal: 1. 18.</note> writeth thus; after three yeares I came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to<note place="margin">Acts 9. 26.</note> ſee <hi>Peter,</hi> and abode in his houſe 15 dayes; ſo this was the 28 yeare of our Lord when <hi>Peter</hi> is firſt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he was after impriſoned at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 12. 2. That it was the 46 yeare of our Lord, it is proved thus, the Countreys about, that<note place="margin">Acts 12. 20.</note> is, <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> were then nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the Kings proviſion, but that proviſion <hi>Claudius</hi> made<note place="margin">Suetonius in Claudio.

            <p>Againe, immediately after the<note place="margin">Acts 12. 23.</note> Scripture mentioneth the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> but <hi>Herod</hi> was made King in the firſt yeare of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> and reigned ſeven yeares, ſo he dyed in the fourth yeare of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and conſequently as is ſaid the 46 yeare of our Lord, <hi>Peter</hi> being now in priſon at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> And thus the ſecond time that <hi>Peter</hi> is mentioned to

be in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the 46 yeare<note place="margin">Others num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe 14 yeares from his firſt going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo this Counſell is holden <hi>An:</hi> 51.</note> of Chriſt; afterwards when the Apoſtles held the Counſell in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it was the 48 yeare of our Lord, it is proved by St <hi>Paul,</hi> who after he had mentioned his converſion, and his firſt going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof we ſpake before, he ſaith thus; Then after 14 yeares I went up againe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo it was the 48 yeare of our Lord, this being 14 yeares after his converſion, and he converted in the 35 yeare of our Lord: Thus it is proved that in the yeares of our Lord, 35, 38, 46, 48, <hi>Peter</hi> was in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it reſteth to prove, that in the meane ſpace <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was not at <hi>Rome</hi> between 35 &amp; 38 yeares, I have this proofe; In the yeare of our Lord, 37. <hi>Pilate</hi> wrote his Letters unto <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of Chriſt, and of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and how the <hi>Jewes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him a God, whereby the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41908:96"/>
Emperour was ſo moved, that he would needs make Chriſt a God in <hi>Rome:</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> had been in <hi>Rome, Pilate's</hi> Letters had not been neceſſary, the Emperour ſhould have had better inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus in theſe three yeares <hi>Peter</hi> was not in <hi>Rome,</hi> between the 38 yeare, and the 46 yeare, they ſay (ſuch is their impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop all the while in <hi>Antioch;</hi> If it be ſo, then by their own confeſſion he was not at <hi>Rome:</hi> but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plaine, he was neither at <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor yet at <hi>Rome,</hi> and how theſe ſeven yeares are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, mark and thou ſhalt ſee.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of theſe ſeven<note place="margin">Acts 9. 32, 33. 35.</note> years, <hi>Peter</hi> goeth forth a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, firſt into all <hi>Jewry, Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome continuance; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Acts 9. 39. 43.</note> he goeth up to the Saints at <hi>Lydda,</hi> and there tarrieth; from thence he goeth to <hi>Joppa,</hi> and there tarrieth (<hi>dies multos</hi>) a long while; from thence he

goeth to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and there converteth <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the firſt<note place="margin">Acts 10 24.</note> 
               <hi>Gentile</hi> that ever he converted, as is plain by the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then he abideth certain dayes at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> all this well nigh 400.<note place="margin">Acts 12. 2.</note> miles from <hi>Antioch:</hi> And now for proof, he makes no haſt to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he comes home again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he is again joyned to the Apoſtles, and now the Apoſtles hear word that certain <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> are converted, not by <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 11. 20, 22.</note> but by certain Diſciples that fled when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 60. &amp; 8. 1.

               <hi>Paul,</hi> from thence they come again both to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and there tarrieth afterward one whole yeare; about this time ſaith<note place="margin">Acts 12. 2. 4.</note> the Scripture, <hi>Peter</hi> was put in priſon, which was, is proved, the year of our Lord 46. and that he continued in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ever ſince <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſent to <hi>Antioch,</hi> we have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture when he was delivered<note place="margin">Acts 12. 15.</note> out of priſon, and knockt at <hi>Maries</hi> doore, <hi>Rhoda</hi> the Maid knew him by his voice, and ſo well, that the Diſciples ſaid ſhe was mad, or elſe it was <hi>Peters</hi> Angel, yet were the thing never ſo incredible, ſhe ſaid ſhe was ſure it was even he; this perfect knowledg of a mans voyce required ſome continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of acquaintance.

               <hi>Acts</hi> do ſpecifie certain years after, in which <hi>Paul</hi> and they were together: So, now being at <hi>Rome</hi> again, it agreeth well that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> was written about the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the year of our Lord 56. at which time <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> as may be proved above all gueſſes and conjectures, out of the word of God.</p>
